Abstract = {{In the present problem, two-phase mixed convection of a non-Newtonian
   nanofluid in a porous H-shaped cavity is studied. Inside the enclosure
   there are four rotating cylinders, using the Boussinesq approximation,
   mixed convection is created. Nanofluid includes H2O + 0.5\% CMC and
   copper oxide nanoparticles. The mixture model was used to model physical
   phenomena. Different aspect ratios were used in order to achieve the
   best heat transfer rate. The Darcy and Richardson numbers ranges are
   10(-4) <= Da <= 10(-2) and 1 <= Ri <= 100 respectively. Also, the aspect
   ratio and dimensionless angular velocities of cylinders ranges are 1.4
   <= AR <= 1.6 and -10 <= Omega <= 10 respectively. Streamlines and
   isotherm-lines contours have been obtained for the variation of Darcy
   and Richardson numbers, aspect ratio and angular velocity. The heat
   transfer rates have been obtained for various aspect ratios, Darcy and
   Richardson numbers, and the direction of the cylinder's rotation, and
   are compared with each other. The results show that the direction of
   cylinders rotation influences the strength and extent of the generation
   vortices. Also, the use of porous material in high permeability can be a
   good alternative to lowering the angular velocity of the cylinders and
   ultimately reducing the need for less energy. (C) 2019 The Society of

Journal = {{ULTRASONICS SONOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{58}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The most crucial step towards conducting experimental studies on
   thermophysical properties and heat transfer of nanofluids is,
   undoubtedly, the preparation step. It is known that good dispersion of
   nanoparticles into the base fluids leads to having long-time stable
   nanofluids, which result in having higher thermal conductivity
   enhancement and lower viscosity increase. Ultrasonic treatment is one of
   the most effective techniques to break down the large clusters of
   nanoparticles into the smaller clusters or even individual
   nanoparticles.
   The present review aims to summarize the recently published literature
   on the effects of various ultrasonication parameters on stability and
   thermal properties of various nanofluids. The most common methods to
   characterize the dispersion quality and stability of the nanofluids have
   been presented and discussed. It is found that increasing the
   ultrasonication time and power results in having more dispersed and
   stable nanofluids. Moreover, increasing the ultrasonication time and
   power leads to having higher thermal conductivity and heat transfer
   enhancement, lower viscosity increase, and lower pressure drop. However,
   there are some exceptional cases in which increasing the ultrasonication
   time and power deteriorated the stability and thermophysical properties
   of some nanofluids. It is also found that employing the ultrasonic
   horn/probe devices are much more effective than ultrasonic bath devices;
   lower ultrasonication time and power leads to better results.}},

Title = {{Effect of different surfactants on the pool boiling heat transfer of
   SiO2/deionized water nanofluid on a copper surface}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{145}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The boiling heat transfer is one of the most widely applied heat
   transfer processes in today's industries. This study is an experimental
   investigation of the pool boiling heat transfer in a nanofluid composed
   of deionized (DI) water and silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanoparticles with
   added surfactants (Ps20, CTAB, SLS) on a copper surface at various
   nanofluid concentrations, under atmospheric pressure conditions. The
   nanofluid was synthesized using a two-step method and showed acceptable
   stability. The concentration of surfactant in nanofluid for all prepared
   nanofluids is 1/2 of nanoparticles mass. For the sake of repeatability
   and accuracy of the experiments, the 20 deionized water was measured
   three times and was found to match the relations proposed in the
   literature. The results show the boiling heat transfer to be enhanced in
   the DI water with added surfactants compared with the deionized water.
   Moreover, the DI water with added surfactants observed a better boiling
   heat transfer compared to the DI-water-based SiO2 nanofluid with added
   surfactant. In addition, the boiling heat transfer was reduced as the
   concentration of the SiO2 nanofluid containing SLS and CTAB surfactants
   was increased. Meanwhile, increasing the concentration of the SiO2
   nanofluid containing Ps20 surfactants from 0.01 to 0.1 vol\% enhanced
   the heat transfer. However, increasing the concentration to 1 vol\%
   reduced the heat transfer drastically. Therefore, at all heat fluxes,
   the nanofluid specimens with added SLS surfactants were associated with
   the highest boiling heat transfer, which was followed by the nanofluid
   with added CTAB, and the nanofluid with Ps20 (SLS > CTAB > Ps20). In
   conclusion, ranking them by impact, anionic, cationic, and nonionic
   surfactants (nonionic < cationic < anionic) resulted in the largest to
   smallest increase in the Boiling Heat Transfer Coefficient (BHTC) in the
   nanofluids.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, molecular dynamics simulation of Couette and Poiseuille
   Water-Copper nanofluid flows in rough and smooth nanochannels was
   performed. The Lennard-Jones equation is considered as Water-Water
   intermolecular interaction, while Hamaker's equation is considered to be
   the interaction between Water-Copper and Copper-Copper particles. PPPM
   algorithm is used to calculate the electric potential. It is concluded
   that increasing the channel height reduces the effect of the surface on
   the fluid and reduces the flow rate of the nanofluid. Also, the slip
   velocities on the bottom and top walls remain almost the same.
   Furthermore, nanoparticles have caused fluctuations in the middle area,
   which are due to the effects of the surface of the nanoparticles
   relative to the base fluid of the Water. As expected, the presence of
   nanoparticles in the middle area and the interaction between the surface
   and the fluid in this area has caused abnormal fluctuations.}},

Title = {{An updated review on application of nanofluids in heat exchangers for
   saving energy}},
Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{198}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper a brief review on application of nanofluids in heat
   exchangers has been addressed. One of the barriers to increase the
   capacity of different industries is the lack of response of heat devices
   in higher capacities. In addition, increasing capacity leads to an
   increase in pressure drop and this is one of the most important
   restrictions on the large industries. Conventional methods of increasing
   heat transfer greatly increase the pressure drop, and according to the
   results of previous studies, using the special nanofluids, the thermal
   efficiency of the heat exchanger can be increased significantly, which
   is one of the most important thermal devices in the industry. In this
   research, firstly a review of nanofluids studies and introduction of
   nanofluids is presented, then their simulation methods are investigated,
   and finally, studies on the used tubes in the heat exchangers have been
   investigated, and studies of the plate heat exchanger, helical heat
   exchanger, shell and tube heat exchanger, and double-tube heat exchanger
   have been examined. The enhancement of thermal and hydraulic performance
   of heat exchangers is very important in terms of energy conversion, and
   also is important in the economic recovery of systems through savings.
   This paper examines previous studies on heat exchangers and using of
   nanofluids in them. The purpose of the paper is not only to describe the
   previous studies, but also to understand the mechanisms of heat transfer
   in the field of using nanofluids in heat exchangers, and also to
   evaluate and compare different heat transfer techniques. Finally, it can
   be concluded that the nanofluids in most cases improve heat transfer,
   which reduce the volume of heat exchangers, saving energy, consequently
   water consumption and industrial waste.}},

Title = {{Modeling of Subcooled Flow Boiling with Nanoparticles under the
   Influence of a Magnetic Field}},
Journal = {{SYMMETRY-BASEL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Subcooled flow boiling is one of the major issues in the nuclear and
   power generation industries. If the fluid inlet temperature in the
   boiling area is less than the boiling temperature, the boiling process
   is called subcooled boiling. The symmetry of a physical system is a
   constant property of the system and is fixed by deformation. Using
   magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) forces and broken symmetry induced by
   nanosized particles, fluid and thermal systems can be more controlled.
   In this study, the effect of a magnetic field and nanoparticles on
   subcooled flow boiling in a vertical tube was investigated. For this
   purpose, a one-dimensional numerical code was used to simulate the flow
   and variations of various parameters that have been investigated and
   evaluated. The results showed that as the flow entered the heated area,
   the vapor volume fraction, Froude number, fluid cross-sectional area
   forces, mixture velocity, fluid velocity, bubble departure diameter,
   liquid and vapor Reynolds numbers, squared ratio of the Froude number to
   the Weber number, and fluid cross-sectional area forces coefficient
   increased. In the same region, the Eotvos number, root mean square (RMS)
   of the fluid cross-sectional area force, sound velocity, liquid
   superficial velocity, critical tube diameter, bubble departure
   frequency, and density of the active nucleation site were reduced. It
   was also observed that after the heated area and under the influence of
   the magnetic field and the nanoparticles, the values of the vapor volume
   fraction, Froude number, fluid cross-sectional area force, mixture
   velocity, fluid velocity, vapor, liquid Reynolds number, and squared
   ratio of the Froude number to the Weber number were decreased. Moreover,
   there was no significant effect on the Eotvos number, liquid superficial

Abstract = {{Mechanical process of Accumulative Roll Bonding (ARB) is one of the
   severe plastic deformation methods which can be contributed to produce
   ultrafine grind composites. In this research, multi-layered composite of
   stainless steel/aluminum/copper after five cycles of accumulative roll
   bonding has been produced. In order to examine the microstructure of the
   sample during the process of ARB, images of optical microscope (OM), and
   scanning electron microscope (SEM) of sample cross section were
   provided. Moreover, inter-diffusion of atoms of Steel, Al, and Cu has
   been examined through linear elemental analysis. In order for
   recognition of created phases in composite, X-Ray diffraction analysis
   (XRD) has been done. At the end, a test of hardness has been done on
   various layers of composite. The results showed that in the first and
   second cycle of the ARB, it has not been created any plastic instability
   in the layers. By increasing the number of the cycle of accumulative
   roll bonding up to the five, plastic instability (necking and
   fracturing) will be observed. According to the result of this study,
   during the process of ARB, proper connection has been created among the
   layers. By increasing the cycles up to the five, a composite of aluminum
   matrix, grinds reinforcing Cu, and steel will be produced. In addition,
   the investigation of atomic diffusion indicates that the diffusion of
   the atoms of Cu and Al is greater than Steel. Formation of intermetallic
   compound of Al2Cu through the ARB process in Stainless Steel/Al/Cu
   composite is another finding of the present study.}},

Abstract = {{The natural heat convection within a square enclosure filled with
   water-Al2O3 nanofluid has been studied numerically in the presence of a
   magnetic field. The effect of heat source geometry attached to the
   bottom wall on the Nusselt number was investigated by changing its
   nondimensional width and height, and side walls thickness of the
   enclosure ranging from 0.1 to 0.5, 0.1 to 0.8 and 0.05 to 0.2,
   respectively. A regression model has been obtained along with conducting
   a sensitivity analysis seeking an optimal heat transfer. Results, reveal
   that Nusselt number increases by enlarging the fin, and reaching a peak
   point before it declines. Thus, interestingly, the ever-increasing heat
   transfer by means of fin size does not retain and there is an optimal
   point wherein the maximum heat transfer occurs. Moreover, the thermal
   performance of the system largely depends on the fin size rather than
   the relative side walls thickness. However, its effect intensifies as
   the fin width increases. Results of optimization show that the maximum
   heat transfer occurs at W = 0:4615, H = 0:6467 and L-b = 0:2.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the rheological behavior of a mixture of water and
   ethylene glycol containing a combination of multi-walled carbon
   nanotubes and aluminum oxide in a temperature range of 25 to 50 degrees
   C was investigated experimentally. Homogeneous and stable samples with
   different concentrations were made by suspending carbon nanotubes and
   aluminum dioxide in a 50-50 mixture of water and ethylene glycol using a
   two-step method. The viscosity of nanofluid samples at different shear
   rates was measured by the DV-I PRIME Brookfield digital viscometer,
   which uses a rotating cylinder method. The results showed that, despite
   the Newtonian behavior of the base fluid, all nanofluid samples showed a
   non-Newtonian behavior. It was also observed that non-Newtonian behavior
   of nanofluid follows the Power law model. Thus, using the curve fitting,
   the consistency index and the power law index were obtained. Moreover,
   mathematical correlations were proposed as a function of temperature and
   volume fraction for obtaining consistency index and the power-law index.
   Comparisons showed the accuracy of proposed correlations. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{This numerical study aims to focus on the effect of difference between
   the inlet temperatures of working fluids on the hydrothermal

   The water flows in the annulus side and the water based hybrid
   nano-fluid containing Fe3O4 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) passes through
   the tube side of heat exchanger. Temperature-dependent thermal
   conductivity and viscosity are considered for the non-Newtonian hybrid
   nano-fluid. The effects of Fe3O4 and CNT volume fractions as well as the
   Reynolds number on the performance metrics of the heat exchanger are
   also assessed. The results revealed that the increase of difference
   between the inlet temperatures of working fluids leads to the
   augmentation of heat transfer rate, overall heat transfer coefficient
   (except at Reynolds number of 500), heat exchanger effectiveness and
   PEC; while the pumping power diminishes with the increase of inlet water

Abstract = {{Passive latent heat thermal energy storage approach incorporating phase
   change materials (PCM) is a brilliant technique to tackle high energy
   consumption issue in buildings. This paper investigated the thermal
   performance of the conventional walls of buildings in Isfahan, Iran with
   the inclusion of thirteen different phase change materials. The studied
   base wall was composed of plaster (2 cm), clay brick (15 cm), and cement
   (3 cm). The effect of PCM position inside the wall on the heat transfer
   was assessed in two scenarios, namely: close to the interior and close
   to exterior. The nonlinear governing equations were solved using the
   finite volume method. The results show that the performance of PCM-based
   wall is strongly influenced by the thermal conductivity, phase-change
   enthalpy and melting temperature of PCM. A PCM can more efficiently
   reduce the heat transfer to the interior space in case it has a lower
   thermal conductivity, has a higher latent heat of phase-change, and its
   phase-change temperature is closer to the room temperature. Moreover,
   the thermal conductivity has priority over other PCM thermophysical
   properties. The lower PCM thermal conductivity leads to transfer the
   lower amount of heat to the interior space. A two-fold increase in the
   thickness of the PCM leads to less than a twofold reduction in the heat
   transfer. Among the studied PCMs, the heat transfer reduction by
   Enerciel 22 was within the range 15.6-47.6\%, while this range was
   2-7.8\% for CaCl2 center dot 6H(2)O.}},

   appropriately to recover wasted heat from various industrial processes.
   In the current work, new thermodynamic modeling was developed to
   harvesting waste heat from an integrated system includes an externally
   fired gas turbine and a biomass gasifier by three thermoelectric WHRSs.
   The biomass system consisted a gas turbine cycle, an organic Rankine
   cycle (ORC) and a domestic water heater were first thermodynamically
   modeled, and then effects of adding thermoelectric WHRSs to different
   locations of the system were investigated. It is observed that first law
   efficiency of the system (eta(1)) will become 17.11\% (an increase of
   0.35\%) if the total output heat from the stack enters WHRSs. The
   efficiencies of the system can be increased from 16.76\% to 17.93\% by
   placing a WHRS on the condenser of ORC. Moreover, the operating
   parameters have a significant effect on the integrated system
   efficiency; the influence of increasing alpha(GE) on the efficiencies is
   in contrast to the effect of enhancing alpha(cond). In addition, an
   economic assessment of integrating WHRSs with the biomass gasifier
   integrated system is conducted and the conditions are indicated under
   which the proposed system is profitable. Furthermore, the results of
   genetic algorithm based multi-objective optimization shows that with the
   use of gamma(Du) = 2 and gamma(L,ORC) = 30 defined thermal efficiencies
   are at their optimum state.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-objective optimization of a hybrid building integrated
   photovoltaic/thermal (BIPVT) system and earth-air heat exchanger (EAHE)
   is studied. According to the position of the BIPVT and EAHE systems, two
   different configurations (i.e. configuration A and configuration B) are
   examined. In the heating mode of the configuration A, the cold outdoor
   air is twice preheated by passing through the EAHE and BIPVT systems. In
   the cooling mode of the configuration A, the hot outdoor air is
   precooled by flowing inside the EAHE system and the photovoltaic (PV)
   modules are cooled using the building exhaust air. The cooling mode of
   the configuration B is similar to the configuration A, while in the
   heating mode of the configuration B, the outdoor air first enters the
   BIPVT collector and then passes through the EAHE system. The annual
   total amount of produced energy and exergy are considered as the
   objective functions. The effective parameters in the optimization
   process include the air mass flow rate, the length, width and depth of
   BIPVT channel and the length and depth of EAHE system. The outcomes
   revealed that the annual total energy and exergy outputs of the optimum
   configuration A are 96448.6 kWh and 10015.5 kWh, respectively, while
   these values for the optimum configuration B are respectively 98537.5
   and 9888.4 kWh.}},

   performance of a water-based hybrid nanofluid containing both Fe3O4

   field is created by three pairs of permanent magnets. The effects of

   magnetic field strength are investigated. The acquired data for the case
   of without magnetic field confirmed higher values of heat transfer and
   pressure drop as a result of utilizing nanofluid compared with water.
   Additionally, it was found that the Nusselt number and pressure drop of
   the studied nanofluid samples increase significantly under the magnetic
   field. Moreover, the influence of magnetic field increases with an
   increase in the nanoparticle concentrations and magnetic field strength
   and decrease in the Reynolds number. The maximum increments of 109.31\%

Abstract = {{The aim of this experimental assessment is to examine the influence of

   water-Fe3O4 and water-Fe3O4/CNT ferro-fluids. Magnetic field is created
   by an electromagnet composed of a core made of ferrite and two copper

   examined and the findings are compared with those of the constant
   magnetic field. The outcomes revealed that the pattern of
   thermal-conductivity in the attendance of a constant magnetic field is
   initially ascending and then descending. In addition, it was found that
   the descending trend of the thermal-conductivity can be prevented by
   using an oscillating magnetic field. Moreover, the results depicted that
   the most effective oscillating magnetic field has a frequency equal to
   the inverse of one minute less than time to reach the highest
   thermal-conductivity in the attendance of constant magnetic field.
   According to the results, the highest increase in the average

Abstract = {{In this paper, a numerical study has been examined on the effect of the
   presence of a magnetic field on the rate of convective heat transfer and
   entropy generation of a hybrid nanofluid (water/Al2O3-CuO (50/50)) in a
   square diagonal cavity. The horizontal walls of the insulating cavity
   and fixed temperature source are set on the left and right vertical wall
   with cold temperature. The governing equations are solved by finite
   volume method using the SIMPLE algorithm. In this paper, the effect of
   the Richardson number, Hartman number, thermal source length on hybrid
   entropy generation and convective heat transfer rate has been examined.
   Using the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) method, a polynomial
   equation is obtained between the three parameters given for the Nusselt
   number, total entropy generation and Bejan number. Then the sensitivity
   of responses to factors is checked. Finally, depending on the importance
   of each of the responses, we use the optimal points where simultaneously
   the highest Nu number, the lowest entropy generation, and Bejan number
   occur. The results show that with increasing Richardson number, heat
   transfer rate is reduced, and this reduction is more pronounced in
   smaller Hartmann number. Also, total entropy generation increased with
   increasing Richardson number, but Bejan number reduced. With increasing
   the intensity of the magnetic field and reducing the length of the
   thermal source, the heat transfer rate also reduces. However, with
   increasing the intensity of the magnetic field, the total entropy
   generation and Bejan number increase. Also, with increasing the length
   of the thermal source, the total entropy generation and Bejan number
   increase.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, two novel configurations of the building integrated
   photovoltaic thermal (BIPVT)-compound earth air heat exchanger (EAHE)
   system are proposed. Both the configurations operate in two modes,
   namely heating and cooling modes. In the heating mode of the
   configuration A, the cold outdoor air is twice preheated by passing
   through the EAHE and BIPVT systems. In the cooling mode of the
   configuration A, the hot outdoor air is precooled by flowing inside the
   EAHE system and the PV modules are cooled using the building exhaust
   air. The cooling mode of the configuration B is similar to the
   configuration A, while in the heating mode of the configuration B, the
   outdoor air first enters the BIPVT collector and then passes through the
   EAHE system. The energetic and exergetic performances of the
   configurations are investigated for climatic conditions of Kermanshah,
   Iran. In addition, the impacts of length, width, and depth of air duct
   located underneath the PV panels, air mass flow rate, length and inner
   diameter of the pipe of EAHE system on the annual average energetic and
   exergetic aspects of the best configuration of the BIPVT-EAHE system are
   evaluated. The outcomes revealed that the annual rate of thermal energy,
   electrical energy, and thermal exergy captured from the configuration A
   are respectively 3499.59, 5908.19, and 55.59 kWh, while these values for
   the configuration B are respectively 3468.16, 5969.87, and 51.76 kWh. In
   addition, it was found that the configuration A has superior energetic
   performance than the configuration B, while the overall exergetic
   performance of the configuration B is higher than the configuration A.
   Furthermore, it was depicted that both the energetic and exergetic
   performances of the suggested configurations intensify by augmenting the
   duct length, duct width, and tube diameter whereas they decline with an

Abstract = {{This study discussed the rheological behavior of
   MWCNT-CuO(30-70\%)/SAE50 nanofluid experimentally at the volume
   fractions of 0-1 percent in the temperature range of 25-50 degrees C and
   the shear rate of 666-7998 s(-1). Due to a nonlinear relationship
   between the shear rate and shear stress, nanofluid behavior can be
   considered close to the non-Newtonian fluids. Nanofluid viscosity
   reduces by adding nanoparticles at the volume fractions of 0.0625\%,
   0.125\%, and 0.25\% (maximum reduction of 15\%). Nanofluid viscosity
   increases at the volume fractions higher than 0.5\%, as the maximum
   viscosity increase, i.e. 14\%, occurs at the volume fraction of 1\%.
   Reduction of viscosity at low volume fractions and a small increase of
   viscosity at higher volume fractions show that this nanofluid can be
   used in the applications other than lubrication. This study presents for
   the first time a new mathematical relation for the relative viscosity of
   MWCNT-CuO(3-70\%)/SAE50. In the relation provided to predict the
   relative viscosity of nanofluid, R-2 = 0.9453, which indicates its
   accuracy. This study also discussed the sensitivity of the relative
   viscosity of nanofluid to temperature and volume fraction. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{In this study, the mixed convection of nanofluid containing water as a
   base fluid and aluminum oxide as a nanoparticles in a lid-driven cavity
   including a hot elliptical centric cylinder is studied. The effects of a
   hot elliptical centric cylinder, cavity angle (alpha) and solid volume
   fraction (phi) of nanoparticles are investigated. The obtained results
   show that with increase of solid volume fraction and due to more
   condensation of nanofluid and more Brownian motion, the claustration
   phenomena occurred and resulting an increase of thermal conductivity and
   convection heat transfer coefficients (k, h) and heat transferred more
   from the higher temperature surface to the lower temperature wall. Also,
   heat transfer (q) and Nusselt number (Nu) increased due to the increase
   in the temperature difference (Delta T) between the hot cylinder and
   lower temperature surfaces at a constant cavity angle, solid volume
   fraction and Richardson number (Ri). By considering all diagrams, the
   highest value of nanofluid's velocity was around the cap and right-side
   wall and the lowest velocity value was around the thermal cylinder and
   left side and down walls. The results show that the increase rate of the
   Nu from 0 to 45 degrees in phi = 0.1\% and 0.2\% and base fluid is equal
   to 1.7, 0.8 and 0.3 respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, the effect of the presence of radiation on the convection
   heat transfer rate and the nanofluid entropy generation within a
   diagonal rectangular chamber is investigated numerically in the presence
   of a magnetic field. The governing equations have been solved via finite
   volume method using the simple algorithm. In this paper, the effects of
   Rayleigh number, Hartmann number, magnetic field angle changes, chamber
   angle changes, entropy parameter, radiation parameter and volume percent
   of nanoparticles on the entropy generation and heat transfer have been
   investigated. The results show that with increasing Rayleigh number and
   decreasing the Hartmann number, the Nusselt number and entropy
   generation increase and the Bejan number decreases. By increasing the
   angle of the magnetic field, the heat transfer rate and the entropy
   generation are reduced and the Bejan number increases. By increasing the
   angle of the chamber at high Rayleigh numbers, the heat transfer rate
   increases, or by adding 6\% of the nanoparticles to the base fluid, the
   heat transfer rate increases by 9.3\% and the entropy generation
   increases by 15.5\% in the absence of radiation. This increase in the
   Rd=3 radiation parameter is 5.4\% and 6.2\%, respectively. It was also
   observed that the Nusselt number and the entropy generation increased,
   and with increasing the radiation parameter, the Bejan number decreased.
   Increasing the heat transfer rate is more significant at higher Rayleigh
   numbers by increasing the radiation parameter.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of an axial magnetic field on the heat transfer and nanofluid

   model was applied to approximate the viscosity of the nanofluid and the
   effective thermal conductivity. Furthermore, proper transformations for
   the velocity and temperature were applied in this study to obtain a set
   of ODEs (ordinary differential equations) for basic equations governing
   the flow, heat and mass transfer. In addition, the 4th order Runge-Kutta
   (RK) numerical scheme was applied to solve the differential equations
   along with the associated boundary conditions. The impacts of different
   parameters, including Hartmann number, Reynolds number, radiation
   parameter and aspect ratio, on the heat transfer and flow features were
   studied. According to the results, the value of the Nusselt number

Abstract = {{A new optimization/statistical approach of ``Robust Weighted Least
   Squares Support Vector Regression{''} algorithm (RWLS-SVR) is provided
   for the first time. The experimental achieved amounts of the thermal
   conductivity for a new hybrid nanofluid of water/Graphene Oxide-Silicon
   Carbide, are examined at different values of temperature and
   nanoparticles volume fraction. A Support Vector Regression is a
   supervised learning regression algorithm based on the Support Vector
   Machine methodology. However in the Least Squares Support Vector Machine
   method, the inequality constraints are converted to equality constraints
   and the sum squared error function is employed. Moreover a LS-SVR is
   applied to the problem in order to calculate the error variables.
   Afterwards, the weights computed based on the error variables are
   applied to the optimization problem in order to reduce the effects of
   outliers on the final results. As a result, the WLS-SVR method does not
   significantly increase the computational burden, but it provides
   sparseness and robustness. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The present study dealt with the numerical simulation of nanofluid flow
   in a double tube heat exchanger equipped with twisted tape.
   Alumina/water nanofluid and pure water are considered to be working
   fluids. A two-phase mixture model was employed for nanofluid flow
   simulation. The effect of nanofluid and twisted tape on the hydrodynamic
   and thermal performance of the heat exchanger was studied. Next, the
   focus was placed on the effect of the surface roughness (material type)
   of twisted tape on heat transfer and pressure drop in the heat
   exchanger. The results are presented as the temperature distribution,
   velocity field, Nusselt number, and pressure drop for various Reynolds
   numbers, nanofluid concentrations, pitch ratios, and tape insert
   materials. The results revealed that the use of twisted tape improved
   the Nusselt number up to 22\%; also, adding alumina particles to water
   augmented heat transfer up to 30\% and increased pressure drop up to
   40\%. Tapes with more roughness provided heat transfer enhancement of up
   to 16\%, whereas the friction factor increased up to 21\%.}},

Abstract = {{This study experimentally investigated the preparation method,
   stability, measurement, and modeling of the thermal conductivity of
   water/graphene oxide-silicon carbide nanofluid. In this study, the
   nanofluid was prepared via a two-stage method. Moreover, the SEM and XRD
   tests were used to investigate surface and atomic structure of
   nanoparticles. A probe-type ultrasonic stirrer was used to achieve
   stability and homogenized distribution of particles in the base fluid.
   Then, the nanofluid stability was assessed using the DLS test. According
   to the results, the base fluid contained nano-sized particles. Moreover,
   the thermal conductivity measurement of the hybrid nanofluid was carried
   out in the temperature and volume concentration ranges of 25-50 degrees
   C and 0.05-1 vol\%, respectively. The experimental variables were the
   nanofluid's temperature and volume concentration. Results showed that
   the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid increased with increasing
   volume concentration and temperature. Although nanoparticle
   concentration has a greater impact than temperature, changes in thermal
   conductivity are greater at higher temperatures. The greatest increase
   in thermal conductivity of nanofluid was 33.2\% at the concentration of
   1 vol\% and temperature of 50 degrees C. To calculate thermal
   conductivity of this nanofluid, a highly accurate experimental equation
   was developed using the laboratory data curve fitting method. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{The neural network is a technique to reduce cost and time that can be a
   good alternative to practical testing. This technique, which has become
   more important with the advancement of computer science, can also be
   used to predict the properties of nanofluids. To prove this claim, in
   this research, an optimal artificial neural network (ANN) was designed
   to evaluation the thermal conductivity enhancement of the
   SWCNTs/EG-water nanofluid using experimental data. For this goal,
   reported experimental enhancement for various concentrations and
   temperatures were employed. 35 measured data obtained from experiments
   have been applied to utilize ANN modeling. 80\% data were chosen for
   network training and the remaining data were adopted for network
   testing. Based on the minimum mean square error (MSE), ANN model with
   two hidden layers and 4 neurons in each layer was selected. In addition,
   a new correlation was presented for predicting the thermal conductivity
   enhancement. Comparative results showed ANN model can forecast the
   thermal conductivity enhancement of nanofluids appropriately. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{The aim of the current paper is modeling the thermal performance factor
   of water under influence of functionalized multi-walled carbon
   nanotubes. For this purpose, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been
   employed. The thermal performance factor of the nanofluid is related to
   the drop in pressure and heat transfer. Therefore, usually the data
   associated with it does not follow a specific trend. In such cases, the
   neural network can be used well. Here, an optimal neural network was
   designed with 65 neurons, the inputs of which were Reynolds number and
   volume fractions. Moreover, 78 data were used for modeling, which
   included 62 data for training and 16 data for testing the model. With
   the aim of evaluation of the precision of the modeling by ANN, the
   experimental results were compared with neural network outputs in all
   cases. The results revealed that optimal ANN model has adequate
   accurateness to predict the complex trend of thermal performance factor.

Abstract = {{In the present study, the thermal performance of an air-cooled,
   flat-plate heat sink in forced convection was performed using a
   three-dimensional analytical model. To validate the present model, this
   solution is compared with numerical and experimental results that agree.
   This research studies the influence of heat sink thermal performance and
   of environmental parameters on the heat sink's stability against thermal
   stress, which is essential for manufacturers' goals. The effective
   parameters on heat transfer rate from the surface of heat sink were
   investigated. Reynolds and Nusselt numbers, heat transfer coefficient,
   fins height, and fins number were studied under various air flow
   velocities. In addition, the thermal stress (structural stability
   method) was investigated. Enhancement of the airflow velocity caused the
   Nusselt number value to incline, which increases the heat transfer
   coefficient. Increasing the Reynolds number from 3.80{*}10(3) to
   2.28{*}10(4) leads to less thermal stress by 47.36\%, less deformation
   by 50\%, less surface temperature by 28.57\%, and, consequently, less
   geometry failure. Results depicted that pure convection has less heat
   transfer by 1.66\% compared with convection-radiation heat transfer, and
   enhancing the fins number and fins height reduces the surface
   temperature by 25\% and 20\%, respectively. As a result, the chosen
   range of the Reynolds number is totally suitable for this
   high-temperature device that does not allow thermal stress to deform the
   fins of the heat sink. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Exploring the effect of nanoparticle shape on the fluid flow
   characteristics of boehmite alumina nanofluid in a horizontal
   double-pipe minichannel heat exchanger is the goal of this study. The
   proposed boehmite alumina nanofluid could consist of dispersed
   cylindrical, brick, blade, platelet, and spherical shape nanoparticles
   in a mixture of water/ethylene glycol. In this study, the water and
   nanofluid pass through the annulus and tube side of the heat exchanger,
   respectively. To accurately simulate the behavior of nanofluid, the two
   phase mixture model is utilized in the simulation. In this
   investigation, the effect of different Reynolds numbers, nanoparticle
   concentrations and shapes versus important hydrothermal properties are
   investigated. The results show that, the spherical and platelet shape
   lead to the highest and lowest performance index of heat exchanger,
   respectively. Moreover, it is found that the rates of heat transfer,
   overall heat transfer coefficient, pressure drop, and pumping power
   increases with increase in Reynolds number and nanoparticle
   concentration, while the opposite trend is observed for performance
   index of the heat exchanger. For instance, at the Reynolds number of 20
   000, by boosting the nanoparticle concentration from 0.5 to 2\%, the
   performance index for nanofluid containing platelet shape and spherical
   shape nanoparticles reduces by 130.63 and 3.88\%, respectively. (C) 2019

Title = {{Effect of replacing nanofluid instead of water on heat transfer in a

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this study is to conduct a numerical analysis of
   flow and heat transfer of water-aluminum oxide nanofluid in a channel
   with extended surfaces in the presence of a constant magnetic field. The
   channel consists of two parallel plates and five obstacles of constant
   temperature on the lower wall of the channel. The upper wall and the
   inlet and outlet lengths of the lower wall are insulated. A uniform
   magnetic field of the magnitude B0 is located beneath the obstacles. The
   nanofluid enters the channel with a uniform velocity and temperature,
   and a fully developed flow leaves the channel.
   Design/methodology/approach The control volume-based finite difference
   and the SIMPLE algorithm were used for numerical solution. In addition
   to examining the effect of the Reynolds number, the effects of Hartman
   number, the volume fraction of nanoparticles, the height of obstacles,
   the length of obstacles and the distance between the obstacles were
   investigated.
   Findings According to the results, the heat transfer rate increases with
   an increasing Reynolds number. As the Hartmann number increases, the
   heat transfer rate increases. The heat transfer rate also increases with
   an increase in the volume fraction of nanoparticles. The mean Nusselt
   number is reduced by an increasing height of obstacles. An increase in
   the distance between the obstacles in the presence of a magnetic field
   does not have a significant impact on the heat transfer rate. However,
   the heat transfer rate increases in the absence of a magnetic field, as
   the distance between the obstacles increases.
   Originality/value This paper is original and unpublished and is not
   being considered for publication elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, an experimental investigation on the effects of
   temperature and concentration of nanoparticles on the viscosity of
   ZnO-MWCNTs/engine oil (SAE 10W40) hybrid nanolubricant is presented. The
   experiments were repeated at volume fractions of 0.05\%, 0.1\%, 0.2\%,
   0.4\%, 0.6\%, and 0.8\%, temperature range of 5-55 degrees C, and shear
   rates from 666.5 to 13,330 s(-1). The viscosity of hybrid nanolubricant
   was measured using the Brookfield digital viscometer (CAP2000). We found
   that the nanofluid has a Newtonian behavior at all volume fractions and
   temperatures. Also, by increasing the volume fraction of nanoparticles
   and nanotubes at a constant temperature the nanofluid viscosity is
   increased. Nanofluid viscosity decreases with increasing the temperature
   at a constant volume fraction.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the experimental data on the thermal conductivity of EG
   based hybrid nanofluid containing zinc oxide and titanium oxide have
   been used. At the first, three two-variable correlations have been
   proposed using curve-fitting on experimental data. After that, the best
   transfer function for training the artificial neural network has been
   selected. The input variables of neural network were temperature and
   solid volume fraction, while the output variable was the thermal
   conductivity enhancement of the nanofluid. Moreover, the correlation
   outputs, ANN results and experimental data have been compared. The
   results showed that there is a good agreement between experimental data
   and neural network results so that the resulting model of the neural
   network is able to predict the thermal conductivity enhancement of the
   nanofluid. The findings also indicated that the accuracy of the neural
   network is much greater than the curve fitting method to predict thermal
   conductivity enhancement of ZnO-TiO2/EG hybrid nanofluid. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Phase change material (PCM) based heat sink is an appropriate technique
   for electronic devices cooling. PCM-based heat sinks have a low overall
   thermal conductivity. Using vertical fins is a brilliant approach to
   tackle low thermal conductivity issue. The aim of this study is to
   present a correlation to estimate the optimum number of fins and optimum
   PCM volume fraction in a PCM-based heat sink. The objective function is
   defined as the longest safe operating time of the device prior to reach
   the critical temperature. The independent parameters are heat sink
   height, fin thickness and heat flux. Around 900 various geometries of
   heat sink in the height range of 10-30 mm, fin thickness range of
   0.2-0.5 mm were studied for two different input heat fluxes of 5000 and
   10000 W/m(2) to find the optimal number of fins. The analysis of
   variance was used to investigate the regression model reasonableness and
   find the main and interaction effects among the input parameters. The
   Results reveal that the optimal number of fins decreases by increasing
   the fin thickness. The increase in heat sink height results in higher
   optimal fin spacing, which consequently decreases the optimal number of
   fins. For a heat sink with constant width, a larger number of fins is
   required to prevent interfering with thermal performance, as the heat
   flux increases. The proposed correlations cover the Rayleigh number
   range of 3.3 x 10(6) <= Ra <= 5.4 x 10(8). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The use of an air-cooled micro-channel heat sink is becoming
   increasingly widespread to cool supercomputers. Passing air through
   micro-channels, which acts as an absorber, is the main heat transfer
   mechanism for cooling the main board of supercomputers. The present
   study aims to investigate the 3D flow of air on the performance of
   micro-channel heat sinks in which the channels can have five different
   configurations (e.g., circular, hexagonal, rectangular, triangular and a
   straight slot). The effect of the flow rate (Reynolds number) and inlet
   temperature of air on the Nusselt number, heat transfer coefficient,
   pressure drop and required pumping power were investigated. The results
   showed that among the five channel configurations, the triangular shape
   provides the highest thermal performance for cooling a specific
   micro-channel heat sink. However, with respect to manufacturing cost,
   the straight slot configuration is recommended. In the next stage, the
   effect of the manufacturing material was considered with respect to
   aluminum, alumina (92\%), cobalt, stainless steel, copper, and silver
   thermal conductivity. In the final stage, the effect of the air flow
   rate on the thermal stress and deformation of the geometry were studied,
   which provided that the coolant flow rate from 60 to 120 CFM prevents
   body failure. The results of this study could be helpful in the design
   of the cooling system of supercomputers.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a two-phase mixture approach is utilized to examine the
   influence of nanoadditive shape on the fluid flow and heat transfer
   aspects of gamma-AlOOH nano-fluid flowing through a sinusoidal wavy
   channel. The gamma-AlOOH (boehmite alumina) nanoadditives of various
   shapes (i.e. cylindrical, brick, blade, and platelet) are dispersed in
   50/50 water-ethylene glycol mixture as the base fluid. The influence of
   the Reynolds number and nanoadditive volume fraction on the Nusselt
   number, pressure drop, and performance evaluation criterion (PEC) are
   numerically studied for different nanoadditive shapes. It is revealed
   that, among the considered nanoadditive shapes, the platelet shape
   represents the highest heat transfer performance, while the worst
   performance belongs to the brick shape nanoadditives. In addition, the
   findings reveal that for all states, enhancing the Reynolds number
   intensifies the Nusselt number, pressure drop, and PEC of the
   gamma-AIOOH nano-fluid. Moreover, it is found that boosting the
   nanoadditive fraction leads to an enhancement in the Nusselt number and
   PEC of the examined nano-fluids. Furthermore, the pressure drop of all
   the considered nano-fluids enhances with augmenting the Reynolds number.

Abstract = {{This research has experimentally investigated the effect of the size of
   silicon oxide nanoparticles in a base fluid of deionized water on the
   coefficient of pool boiling heat transfer on a copper surface at
   atmospheric pressure. Silicon oxide nanoparticles with concentrations of
   0.01, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 vol\% have been used. The sizes of silicon oxide
   nanoparticles have been determined by TEM tests. The test results
   indicate that these nanoparticles have a roughly spherical structure and
   their average sizes are 11, 50 and 70 nm. Moreover, the degree of
   nanofluid stability (lack of coagulation of nanoparticles) has been
   determined by the Zeta-Potential test. The boiling results of the pure
   water sample show that the curve of boiling heat transfer flux versus
   the excess temperature difference of surface is very close to the
   Rohsenow's curve. The results obtained for nanofluid boiling on copper
   surface indicates that, at all the considered concentrations and
   nanoparticle sizes (except nanoparticle size of 70 nm size and
   concentration of 0.1 vol\%), the boiling heat transfer coefficient for
   the nanofluid sample is much smaller than that of the pure water sample.
   The findings show that by increasing the diameter of silica
   nanoparticles from 11 to 70 nm, the boiling heat transfer coefficient is
   increased. These results show that for all the considered nanoparticle
   sizes and concentrations, the highest boiling heat transfer coefficient
   is achieved by the silicon oxide/deionized water nanofluid with the
   concentration of 0.1 vol\% and particle size of 70 nm. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{In this paper, viscosity of SAE 5W50 oil enriched by MWCNT and ZnO
   nanoparticles with combination ratio of 1:4 is experimentally
   investigated in solid volume fractions of 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,
   and 1\% and temperature range of 5 to 55 degrees C. It is done with the
   aim of feasibility study on achieving a modified nano engine oil that
   can minimize cold start engine damages using nanoparticles. According to
   results, produced nano oil with concentrations less than 0.25\% selected
   as modified engine oil. Almost 9\% reduction in viscosity of nano-oil
   with solid volume fraction of 0.05\% compared to ordinary engine oil in
   5 degrees C and shear rate of 666.5 (1/sec) was one of the very
   interesting results of this investigation which makes pumping easier and
   oil will enter the lubrication cycle faster and this minimizes cold
   start damages. Moreover, Presence of nanoparticles improves heat
   transfer from engine parts. The result showed that in temperature range
   of 35-55 degrees C, and solid volume fractions less than 0.25\%, our
   proposed nano-oil is more appropriate for high temperature usage too,
   because of lower dependency of its viscosity to temperature in
   comparison to pure 5W50 engine oil. A mathematical correlation was
   proposed to predict viscosity of nano-engine oils used in this research.
   R-Squared = 0.9685 of this correlation shows its high accuracy. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{This paper has numerically investigated the convection heat transfer and
   the entropy generation of water-Al2O3 nanofluid in a square cavity,
   under the uniform and non-uniform boundary conditions in the presence of
   a magnetic field. The effect of changes of Rayleigh number, Hartmann
   number, direction of application of magnetic field and volume percent of
   nanoparticles on entropy generation and heat transfer rate have been
   investigated. The results show that increasing the Rayleigh number of
   the gradient increases the temperature and Nusselt number and total
   entropy increase, but the Bejan number decreases. The highest average
   Nusselt number is associated with the sinusoidal temperature profile and
   the highest total entropy generation is related to the first order
   profile. By increasing the strength of the magnetic field, the velocity
   of the flow, the total entropy generation and the heat transfer rate are
   reduced. Increasing the angle of the field from 0 to 45 degrees in all
   temperature profiles, Nusselt number increases. However, with increasing
   angle of the field from 45 to 90, in some temperature profiles the
   Nusselt number has increased, but decreases in other profiles. By
   increasing the volumetric percent of nanoparticles, Nusselt number and
   total entropy generation are also increased. This increase in second
   order profile is the highest and has the lowest value in the sinusoidal
   temperature profile. Finally, it was observed that with an increase in
   the entropy parameter, the total entropy generation has also increased.}},

   measured in different shear rates of 6.12 S-1 to 61.2 S-1. The results
   of viscosity measurement showed that, TiO2/ZnO/EG nanofluid has
   Newtonian behavior in volume fractions of 0.1\%, 0.3\% and 0.5\% and in
   all of the considered temperatures and by increasing volume fraction of

   increasing the temperature, nanofluid viscosity reduces. While, the
   sample nanofluid in volume fractions of 1\% and 1.5\% have non-Newtonian
   behavior similar with power law model with power coefficient less than
   1. For nanofluid samples in 1\% and 1.5\% volume fractions in all
   considered temperatures, the power law model coefficients have been
   calculated by curve-fitting with high accuracy The results indicated
   that, in general, by increasing volume fraction, the apparent viscosity
   enhances and by increasing the temperature, the apparent viscosity

   temperatures of 10, 30 and 50 degrees C has a behavior close to the
   Newtonian fluids. The experimental results showed that the nanofluid
   viscosity in solid volume fraction of 0.85\% and the temperature of 10
   degrees C increased by 83\%. In this study, the highest sensitivity
   (6.5\%) was founded at solid volume fraction of 0.85\%. As a result, in
   low solid volume fractions, adding 10\% excess nanoparticles has no
   effect on the viscosity of the nanofluid, which this issue can be take
   into account as an important achievement in the industrial and
   engineering applications. Also results showed that the shear rate versus
   shear stress is linear in concentration of 0.5\% and 0.45\%, which
   indicates the Newtonian behavior of the fluid. But in volume fraction of
   0.85\% the graph behavior is nonlinear, which indicates the
   non-Newtonian behavior of the nanofluid. A new experimental correlation
   is also proposed to predict the viscosity of the nanofluid in accordance
   with the experimental results. The R-2 for the stated correlation is
   0.9913, which indicates the accuracy of the experimental correlation
   provided to predict the viscosity of the nanofluid in the temperature
   and concentration range. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to investigate the thermal conductivity of a
   hybrid nanofluid containing SWCNT-MgO particles dispersed in ethylene
   glycol as a base fluid. Experiments have executed on nanofluid with
   concentration of 0.015, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 035, 0.45, and 0.55at
   temperatures between 25 and 50 degrees C. The results showed that the
   percentage of thermal conductivity increase with the volume fraction
   variation at higher temperatures is much more than at lower
   temperatures. It was reported that the thermal conductivity at the solid
   volume fraction of 0.55and temperature of 50 degrees C increases>35\%.
   Moreover, the results revealed that using MgO nanoparticle can decrease
   the cost of producing the nanofluid. Since there is no model for
   evaluation of the thermal conductivity of hybrid nanofluid, a new
   correlation based on the experiments has been proposed. R-squared of the
   correlation outputs is 0.993428, which shows a good agreement of the
   proposed correlation with the experimental data and a high accuracy of

Abstract = {{Curve fitting and neural network modeling are suitable methods for
   modeling the complex relationship between various parameters in

   correlation to predict its thermal conductivity. After that, an
   artificial neural network was designed to evaluation of the effects of
   temperature and solid volume fraction on the thermal conductivity of
   nano-antifreeze. For modeling, the volume fraction and temperature were
   applied as input variables. By selecting 9 neurons for the hidden layer,
   the output of the neural network, which was thermal conductivity ratio,
   was obtained. The results showed that the proposed equation has good
   accuracy for engineering applications. However, comparative results
   showed that the neural network has a more accurate prediction than curve
   fitting for the thermal conductivity of the antifreeze containing multi

Abstract = {{.In this study, the impact of thermal radiation on fluid flow and heat
   transfer within a square enclosure filled with ethylene glycol-
   Co3O4-diamond hybrid nanofluid on the basis of experimental data is
   investigated. The governing equations are being solved by employing the
   finite volume method and the SIMPLER algorithm. In investigating this
   problem, the Rayleigh number is taken from Ra=103 to Ra=105 and the
   volume fraction of nanoparticles in the range from 0.0 to 0.075 percent
   and the values from 0 to 2 are considered for the radiation parameter.
   It is observed from the results that in all the considered volume
   fractions, the average Nusselt number is increased by increasing the
   value of the radiation parameter. In all of the considered values for Ra
   and the volume fractions, the most relevant enhancement in the average
   Nusselt number corresponding to the enhancement of the radiation
   parameter is 200.25 percent which occurs in Ra=105 while the volume
   fraction is 0.075. In all volume fractions investigated, the maximum
   value of the stream function is increased by increasing the value of the
   radiation parameter. For all Rayleigh numbers in each of the
   investigated values of the radiation parameter, the maximum value of the
   stream function decreases by increasing the volume fraction of
   nanoparticles. The results of this study reveal that the effect of the
   thermal radiation in high Rayleigh numbers is not considerable.}},

Abstract = {{In the present experimental study, an eco-friendly process (synthesized
   from rice plant source) was used to produce silica nanoparticles. Silica
   nanoparticles are environmentally friendly nanoparticles that have high
   heat transfer potential due to its abundant natural resources, low cost
   synthesis and mass production. The surface and atomic structure of the
   nanoparticles have been investigated through SEM and FTIR tests. After
   production of nanoparticles, water/silica nanofluid samples were
   prepared using two-step method that called eco-friendly nanofluid.
   Stability and thermal conductivity of the eco-friendly nanofluid were
   examined. Investigating the stability of the prepared samples, the DLS
   and TEM tests have been conducted as well as periodic visual observation
   of possible sedimentation over a period of six months through
   photography. The stability results indicated that the prepared samples
   possess excellent nano-structure and it showed long-time stability even.
   after six months of preparation. The thermal conductivity measurement of
   the samples has been done in different temperatures ranging from 25 to
   55 degrees C and solid volume fractions of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1,1.5, 2,
   2.5, and 3\%. The results showed the maximum thermal conductivity
   enhancement of 38.2\% which took place at the temperature of 55 degrees
   C and solid volume fraction of 3\%. Moreover, new precise correlation to
   predict the thermal conductivity of the eco-friendly nanofluid has been
   proposed with the maximum deviation of 2.72\%. Finally, according to the
   results, it can be claimed that synthesis of environmentally friendly
   nanoparticles of silicon oxide with a plant source for nanofluid
   production is important, and this type of nanofluid can be introduced as
   an environmentally friendly alternative fluid with high heat transfer
   potential in thermal systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The present study aimed at predicting the viscosity of MWCNT
   (10\%)-Al2O3 (90\%) hybrid nanofluid in the lubricant 5W50 using
   artificial neural networks (ANNs). Artificial neural network modeling
   was performed in the temperature range of 5-55 degrees C at different
   volumetric fractions of 0.05 to 1\% using 174 experimental data. Three
   inputs and one output (viscosity) were determined for ANN. The
   MLP-artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) was used in this study. The
   results showed the accuracy and reliability of the proposed model
   according to criteria of R-squared and mean square error. According to
   the results of one factor and two factor analysis, temperature variation
   had the greatest effect on viscosity in comparison to shear rate and
   solid volume fractions. Also a correlation was proposed to predict the
   viscosity of the hybrid nanofluid with 5W50 fluid as its base fluid in
   terms of temperature, solid volume fraction and shear rate. The
   R-squared values for the new correlation and ANN were 0.99703 and

Abstract = {{A new homogeneous nanofluid of copper ferrite nanoparticles coated by
   silica dispersed in distilled water as the base fluid is prepared in a
   way to avoid settling and agglomeration. The values of dynamic viscosity
   and electrical conductivity at various temperatures and nanoparticles
   concentrations are experimentally measured. In addition, two empirical
   correlations are provided for them by the curve fitting approach.
   Moreover, the sensitivity analysis beside an enhanced artificial neural
   network is presented to accomplish the obtained results. The margin of
   deviations and experimental results versus those of correlations, imply
   the suitable accuracy of the proposed correlation. It is shown that more
   temperature corresponds to less dynamic viscosity: it also mildly
   increases the electrical conductivity. However, the effect of
   nanoparticle concentrations is more significant. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles are an evolution in improving heat transfer by fluids that
   have the good potential for heat transfer. Thus, in the last two
   decades, interest in researching them has increased dramatically. It has
   been proved that the thermophysical properties of nanofluids are
   different from those of common fluids. One of these properties is
   viscosity, which has a significant contribution to the calculation of
   the fluid heat transfer. In the present study, a brief introduction of
   nanofluid and its applications have been discussed in the first. Then,
   the classical equations suggested for predicting the viscosity of
   nanofluids and their accuracy have been reviewed. The role of effective
   parameters on the nanofluid viscosity has also been reported, indicating
   an increase in the viscosity of the common fluids by increasing the
   nano-additives volume fraction and reducing it with increasing
   temperature. For the effect of increasing nano-additives size, different
   results (decreasing or increasing) on fluid viscosity have been
   reported. The effect of changing the type of nano-additives has also
   been described for a variety of metal/metal oxides nanoparticles, and
   nanomaterial extracted from nature. In addition, nanofluids made with
   carbon nanotubes are described according to the high heat transfer
   coefficient. Finally, the introduction of hybrid nanofluid and their
   comparison with mono nanofluids has been explained by the conclusion
   that hybrid nanofluids can well cover nanofluid weaknesses and improve
   its strengths. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{.In the present study, the effect of horizontal and vertical elliptic
   baffles on the flow, heat transfer and entropy generation of a
   MWCNTs-water nanofluid was investigated. Experimental data were used to
   calculate the viscosity and thermal conductivity of the nanofluid at
   different temperatures and volume fractions. A square enclosure with a
   central elliptic baffle was numerically studied. The elliptic baffle was
   located in two horizontal and vertical positions. The hot baffle was at
   temperature T-h and the walls of the enclosure, except for the lower
   insulated wall, were at temperature T-c. A FORTRAN code based on the
   finite volume method and SIMPLER algorithm was used to analyze mixed
   convection. Nanoparticle volume fractions of 0, 0.002, 0.004, 0.008, and
   0.01 at Richardson numbers of 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 100 at a constant Grashof
   number of 10(4) were studied. Horizontal placement of thermal baffle led
   to a higher heat transfer rate, which is more favorable in terms of heat
   exchange. The entropy generation values in the horizontal position were
   higher than the vertical position. The highest mean Nusselt number and
   total entropy generation were 7.9 and 20.4, respectively. For the
   horizontal placement, the highest mean Nusselt number happens at a
   volume fraction of 0.01 and a Richardson number of 0.01. Studies often
   focus on higher heat transfer rates. However, a horizontal baffle is
   more favorable than the vertical position considering that the greatest
   difference in the total entropy generation is about 8\%.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aimed to investigate the natural convection heat
   transfer in a power-law, non-Newtonian fluid under an applied magnetic
   field inside a C-shaped cavity using the Finite Difference Lattice
   Boltzmann method (FDLBM). Temperature distribution on the wall on the
   left side was non-uniform and sinusoidal with the cold wall on the right
   side. Both top and bottom horizontal walls of the cavity were insulated
   against heat and mass transfer. The Boussinesq approximation was used
   due to negligible density variations, making the hydrodynamic field
   sensitive to the thermal field. Furthermore, the D(2)Q(9) lattice
   arrangement was used for the density and energy distribution functions.
   This study investigates the effects of the Rayleigh number, exponential
   function index, aspect ratio, and the Hartmann number on the flow and
   temperature fields. The results show that the heat transfer rate
   increases with increasing Rayleigh number. Moreover, it was found that
   the Nusselt number decreases with increasing power-law index (n) at
   higher Rayleigh numbers and that an increase in the Hartmann number
   results in a reduced heat transfer rate. The reduction in the heat
   transfer rate caused by the increased Hartmann number in the shear
   thinning fluids was more than that in shear thickening fluids. The
   Nusselt number decreases with increasing cavity aspect ratio for the
   Newtonian and shear thinning fluids, whereas for shear thickening
   fluids, the Nusselt number initially increased and then decreased. (C)

   is investigated in this work. This investigation has been performed at
   different Reynolds number from 5000 to 20,000 for various pitches of

   filed and heat transfer, investigations have been done by four different
   ratios of baffle width to tube diameter (W/D = 0.15, 0.25, 0.34 and
   0.4). Numerical results showed that by increasing the Reynolds number
   Nusselt number increased in all different pitches. Moreover, friction
   factor decreased by increasing Reynolds number. Overall thermal
   performance also totally decreased by increasing Reynolds number. As
   pitch ratio grows from 0.15 to 0.4 Nusselt number, friction factor and
   overall thermal performance increased. Pitches of 0.15, 0.25 and 0.34
   have relatively same overall thermal performance at 20,000 Reynolds

Abstract = {{In this study, the influences of geometrical properties on a solar
   chimney were investigated numerically by applying the K- epsilon
   turbulence model, continuity, momentum, and energy equations in the 3D
   finite volume approach inside a solar chimney power plant. The following
   variables should be involved: collector radius (R-cl), collector height
   (H-cl), chimney height (H-ch), chimney radius (R-ch), and heat flux
   (q{''}). The effects of changes in these variables on temperature,
   velocity, pressure distributions, efficiency, and output power were
   investigated. The results indicated that output power and solar chimney
   efficiency have positive relationships with chimney height and collector
   radius but a negative one with collector height In addition, it was
   found that the parameter of chimney radius has an optimum range which
   has the maximum values for efficiency and output power. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Drilling fluid is one of the most important components of drilling
   operation in oil and gas, mining and geothermal industries.
   Nanotechnology can be used to develop drilling fluid additives that can
   improve the drilling fluid properties. In this work, the feasibility of
   using two types of nanoparticle additives in water-based drilling fluid
   has been investigated. Clay/SiO2 nanocomposite was synthesized (by
   effective hydrothermal method) and successfully characterised. A series
   of experiments are performed to evaluate the effect of SiO2 and clay
   nanoparticles on the rheological and filtration properties of water-base
   drilling fluids. The experiments are conducted at different
   concentrations of Clay/SiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles, and also at a range
   of temperatures. The results showed that the addition of clay and SiO2
   nanoparticles improved the rheological and fluid loss properties. It was
   also noticed that the nanoparticles provide thermal stability to the
   drilling fluid. The experimental results suggest that the Clay/SiO2
   nanoparticles have a more significant impact on the rheological and
   fluid loss properties of the drilling fluid comparing to SiO2
   nanoparticles, particularly at higher temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Nanofluids refers to a new form of heat transfer material that is
   produced by suspending nanoscale metal and non-metallic particles (1-100
   nm) in the base fluid and is one of the newest attempts in the heat
   sciences. In fact, conventional fluids that are used for heat transfer
   have a low thermal conductivity. On the other hand, nano particles
   increase the thermal conductivity coefficient of the fluid due to their
   high thermal conductivity coefficient with presence in the base fluid.
   As a result, the vast investment of advanced countries in
   nanotechnology, research into the thermal properties of nanofluids has
   been given particular attention. In recent years, nanofluids have
   attracted the attention of many scientists due to the significant
   increase in thermal properties. They have been considered as a new
   approach in heat transfer operations. This paper presents an overview of
   researches on rheological behavior of nanofluids. This paper examines
   the effects of parameters such as nanoparticle size and shear rate on
   rheological behavior of nanofluids. In addition, nanoparticle types and
   their volume fraction are investigated. It is observed that nanoparticle
   size, volume fraction and shear rate significantly affect the
   rheological behavior of the nanofluids. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Perforated fins effects on the heat transfer rate of a circular tube are
   examined experimentally. An experimental system is set up through the
   wind tunnel and equipped with necessary measurement tools. Hot water
   passes through the finned tube and heat transfers to the fin-side air
   created using the wind tunnel with different velocities. Two fin sets of
   identical weight are installed on a circular tube with different outer
   diameters of 22 and 26mm. The experiments are conducted at two different
   mass flow rates of the hot water and six Reynolds number of external air
   flow. Considering the four finned tubes and one no finned tube, a total
   of 60 tests are conducted. Results showed that with increasing the
   internal or external flow rates, the effect of larger cross-sectional
   area is greater. By opening holes on the fins, in addition to weight
   loss, the maximum heat transfer rate for perforated fins increases by
   8.78\% and 9.23\% respectively for mass flow rates of 0.05 and 0.1kg/s
   at low external Reynolds number. While, at high external Reynolds
   number, the holes reduces heat transfer by 8.4\% and 10.6\% for mass
   flow rates of 0.05 and 0.1kg/s, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The main aim of this experimental study is to examine the effect of
   cerium oxide nanoparticles on the thermal conductivity of ethylene
   glycol. In this way, cerium oxide nanoparticles with the particle
   diameter of 10-30 nm have been used for making nanofluid samples. The
   samples were made in volume concentration range of 025-2.5\% using a
   two-step method. Visual observation of nanofluid samples showed that
   they have acceptable stability. Transient hot wire method was used for
   measuring the thermal conductivity of the samples. Measurements were
   done for all samples at temperatures ranging from 25to 50 degrees C.
   Measurements showed that the thermal conductivity of nanofluid enhanced
   with increasing temperature and solid volume fraction. The results also
   showed that the thermal conductivity of ethylene glycol could enhance by
   about 22\% when the nano particles volume fraction reaches 25\%. This
   enhancement occurred at 50 degrees C Finally, a mathematical correlation
   was presented to predict the thermal conductivity ratio of Ceo(2)/EG
   using curve-fitting. This correlation, a two variable function of
   temperature and volume fraction, showed a linear relationship between
   thermal conductivity ratio and these variables. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In this study, two-objective optimization is applied to reduce the
   viscosity and increase the thermal conductivity of AlO2-water/EG (20-80)

   optimize both objective functions of viscosity and thermal conductivity
   of nano-fluids via design variables of temperature and volume fraction.
   To approximate objective functions by means of experimental data, the
   MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) neural network modeling is separately
   executed in each objective function. To achieve the design optimal
   points, the neural network modeling has been connected to the
   optimization algorithm and summoned at any evaluation of the fitness

Abstract = {{The present empirical study investigates the synthesis of graphene oxide
   nanoparticles, preparation of water/graphene oxide silicon oxide hybrid
   nanofluid, and parameters affecting viscosity of the nanofluid. Graphene
   oxide nanoparticles are synthesized using the modified Hummer's method.
   Surface structure and atomic structure of the nanoparticles were studied
   using SEM and XRD tests. The nanofluid was then prepared using the two
   step method. DLS tests with various patterns were used, in addition to
   sedimentation photograph capturing method, to measure stability of the
   nanofluid. Results suggested that the nanofluid has a fairly suitable
   nano structure. Viscosity of the nanofluid was measured and studied
   using Brookfield DV2EXTRA-Pro Viscometer, in the temperature range of
   20-60 degrees C with volume concentrations of 0, 0.5, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4,
   0.6, 0.8, and 1\%. Furthermore, effects of parameters such as shear
   rate, and period of applying constant shear rate on viscosity of the
   nanofluid were investigated. The test results showed that viscosity
   behavior of the nanofluid is independent of the shear rate and time of
   shearing. Numerical viscosity measurement results show that viscosity of
   the nanofluid with volume concentration of phi = 1\%, in temperature of
   20 degrees C, increased considerably to mu = 2.42 mPa.s. Viscosity
   changes ratio increases intensively in higher concentrations. Comparing
   empirical results of water/graphene oxide nanofluid viscosity to results
   of the present study shows that, due to the modification of surface
   structure in nanoparticles, the viscosity values have improved
   considerably. An empirical equation is provided to measure the viscosity
   of the nanofluid using this data, which can be used to calculate
   viscosity of the base fluid under effect of temperature, and viscosity
   of the nanofluid under effect of temperature and volume concentration
   variables. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, response surface methodology (RSM) using the
   miscellaneous design model was performed to optimize thermal
   characteristics and rheological properties of Al2O3-EG/water (20\%:80\%)
   nanofluid. A three level factorial design was utilized for optimization.
   In this regard, the effect of temperature, solid volume fraction, and
   their interactions on thermal conductivity and viscosity of Alumina- EG/
   water nanofluid was studied. In order to produce second-order polynomial
   equations for target outputs including thermal conductivity and
   viscosity, 13 experiments were performed. According to the results, the
   predicted values were in sensible agreement with the experimental data.
   In other words, >99\% of viscosity variations and thermal conductivity
   variations of the nanofluid could be predicted by the models, which
   shows the applied model is precise. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of magnetic field on the natural convection of
   Al2O3-water nanofluid inside a square enclosure with isothermal
   obstacles and sinusoidal wall temperature distribution has been
   numerically studied. The sidewalls were subject to sinusoidal boundary
   conditions, while the top and bottom walls were insulated. Two
   isothermal heat sources were implemented within the enclosure at the
   same distance from the center. The governing equations were transformed
   into the algebraic form using finite volume method and were then
   simultaneously solved using the SIMPLE algorithm. The proposed model by
   Vajjha was used to calculate the coefficient of thermal conductivity by
   taking Brownian motion of particles into account. In this study, the
   effect of Rayleigh number, aspect ratio, Hartmann number, direction
   change of applied magnetic field, and the volumetric percentage of
   nanoparticles was investigated. The results indicated that by increasing
   the Hartmann number, the fluid velocity as well as the Nusselt number
   decreased at all volumetric fractions of nanoparticles. An increase in
   the volumetric fraction of nanoparticles increased the Nusselt number,
   so that at a nanoparticle concentration of 6\%, the mean Nusselt number
   increased by 9.04\% compared to that of the base fluid. Moreover, the
   Nusselt number increased by increasing the magnetic field angle and the
   Rayleigh number, while it decreased as the aspect ratio was increased.

   studied using experimental data for thermo-physical properties of
   MgO-MWCNTs/EG Nanofluid. Then, tubes with circular and elliptic sections
   are investigated for different flows, inlet temperatures and
   concentrations. The pressure drop and Nusselt number for each simulation
   are analyzed. Results are presented in terms of temperature
   distribution, pressure drop, Nusselt number and their sensitivity
   analysis for different states. The results indicate that radiators with
   vertical tubes have better efficiency up to 10\% than radiators with
   horizontal tubes. In addition, heat exchangers with circular pipes have
   25\% lower pressure drop and those with elliptical tubes had 10\% higher

Abstract = {{In this paper, at the first, new correlations were proposed to predict
   the rheological behavior of MWCNTs-SiO2/EG-water non-Newtonian hybrid
   nanofluid using different sets of experimental data for the viscosity,
   consistency and power law indices. Then, based on minimum prediction
   errors, two optimal artificial neural network models (ANNs) were
   considered to forecast the rheological behavior of the non-Newtonian
   hybrid nanofluid. One hundred and ninety-eight experimental data were
   employed for predicting viscosity (Model I). Two sets of forty-two
   experimental data also were considered to predict the consistency and
   power law indices (Model II). The data sets were divided to training and
   test sets which contained respectively 80 and 20\% of data points.
   Comparisons between the correlations and ANN models showed that ANN
   models were much more accurate than proposed correlations. Moreover, it
   was found that the neural network is a powerful instrument in
   establishing the relationship between a large numbers of experimental
   data. Thus, this paper confirmed that the neural network is a reliable
   method for predicting the rheological behavior of non-Newtonian
   nanofluids in different models.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we numerically investigated the forced heat-transfer and
   laminar flow in a two-dimensional microchannel whose lower half was
   filled with a porous medium. The nanoparticles used were Fe3O4 and a
   water-based fluid. The nanoparticles were considered in the form of a
   completely stable suspension in a water-based fluid. The nanofluid flow
   in this microchannel was modeled employing the Darcy-Forchheimer
   equation. We also hypothesized that there was a thermal equilibrium
   between the solid phase and nanofluid for energy transfer. And the walls
   of the microchannels were assumed at a constant temperature higher than
   the inlet fluid temperature. Also, the slip boundary condition was
   assumed along the walls. The effects of Darcy number, porosity and slip
   coefficients, and Reynolds number on the velocity and temperature
   profiles, and local Nusselt number were studied in both porous and
   non-porous regions in this research. In this study, the Darcy number was
   assumed to be Da = 0.1 and 0.01, Reynolds number Re = 25, 50, and 100,
   slip coefficient B = 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001, the porosity of the porous
   medium = 0.5 and 0.9, and the volume percentage of the nanoparticles phi
   = 0\%, 2\%, and 4\%. With the Darcy number decreasing, the local Nusselt
   number increased in the non-porous region, and decreased in the porous
   region. And this phenomenon was observed for the first time. The
   increase in the Reynolds number increased the heat transfer in both
   regions. For instance, the local Nusselt number increased 4 times with
   the Reynolds number changing from 25 to 100 under the same conditions.
   The decreased Darcy number in the porous medium increased the amount of
   slip velocity near the walls in the non-porous region, and on the other
   hand, the decreased Darcy number in the porous medium reduced the slip
   velocity in the porous region. Also, the jump observed in the slip
   velocity, was due to the presence of the fluid velocity in the
   microchannel width. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   the effect of bed wall on the particle. Moreover, heat transfer improves
   as the particle moves closer to the wall and the Nusselt number

Abstract = {{In this paper, the rheological behavior of nano-antifreeze consisting of
   50\% vol. water, 50\% vol. ethylene glycol and different quantities of
   functionalized double walled carbon nanotubes has been investigated
   experimentally. Initially, nano-antifreeze samples were prepared with
   solid volume fractions of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1\% using
   two-step method. Then, the dynamic viscosity of the nano-antifreeze
   samples was measured at different shear rates and temperatures. At this
   stage, the results showed that base fluid had the Newtonian behavior,
   while the behavior of all nano-antifreeze samples was non-Newtonian.
   Since the behavior of the samples was similar to power law model, it was
   attempted to find the constants of this model including consistency
   index and power law index. Therefore, using the measured viscosity and
   shear rates, consistency index and power law index were obtained by
   curve-fitting method. The obtained values showed that consistency index
   amplified with increasing volume fraction, while reduced with enhancing
   temperature. Besides, the obtained values for power law index were less
   than 1 for all samples which means shear thinning behavior. Lastly, new
   correlations were suggested to estimate the consistency index and power
   law index using curve-fitting.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal conductivity of EG based hybrid nanofluid containing ZnO-DWCNT
   nanoparticles was investigated experimentally at concentration of 0.045
   to 1.9\% and a temperature of 30-50 degrees C. ZnO particles (with an
   average diameter of 10-30 nm) and double wall carbon nanotubes (DWCNT)
   (internal diameter of 3-5 nm and 5-15 nm external diameter) were mix at
   a ratio of 90\%: 10\% and dispersed in ethylene glycol (EG) then its
   thermal conductivity was measured. The results showed that maximum
   relative thermal conductivity (TCR) at temperature of 50 degrees C and
   the concentration of 1.9\%, equivalent to 24.9\%. Economic evaluation
   and qualitative performance showed that nanofluids hybrid compared with
   ZnO and nanofluids containing MWCNT, in terms of increasing thermal
   conductivity (TCE) and economically, is quite effective. A new
   correlation to predict TCR in terms of concentration of nanoparticles
   and the temperature was proposed. This correlation has a coefficient of
   determination (R-squared) and the maximum error of 0.9826 and 2.9\%,
   respectively. The greatest sensitivity was calculated at a maximum
   temperature and solid volume fraction. Based on the TCR data the
   artificial neural network (ANN) was developed. The best case ANN
   containing two hidden layer and 3 neurons in each layer was obtained.
   This ANN has an R-squared and MSE and was equal to 0.9966\% AARD and
   1.3127e-05 and 0.0489, respectively. The comparison between experimetnal
   data, correlation and ANN outputs shows the accuracy and capability of
   ANN in modeling the TCR data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the present study, the rheological behavior of Fe3O4-MWCNTs/ethylene
   glycol hybrid nanofluid was investigated for different volumetric
   fractions (0.1, 0.25, 0.8,1.25, and 1.8\%) comprising equal amounts of
   suspended iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles and multi-walled carbon
   nanotubes (MWCNTs) within the temperature and shear ranges of 25 to 50
   degrees C and 12.24 to 73.44 s(-1), respectively. The results indicated
   that the nanofluid demonstrates a Newtonian behavior at volume fractions
   of 0.1, 0.25, 0.45, and 0.8\%, whereas it demonstrates a non-Newtonian
   behavior at volume fractions of 1.25 and 1.8\% similar to the power law
   model with an exponent lower than 1. Moreover, it was observed that
   viscosity is directly proportional to volume fraction, and inversely
   proportional to temperature. Then, the effect of nanoparticles and
   nanotubes on the thermal performance of ethylene glycol inside a pipe of
   heat exchanger was evaluated and the results revealed that an increase
   in the volume fraction at all temperatures leads to increased pressure
   drop and heat transfer coefficient. Finally, the results were used to
   develop an experimental equation as a function of temperature and volume
   fraction to estimate nanofluid viscosity in the simulations. The
   predicted values by the equation were in a very good agreement with the
   experimental results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The fluid flow and heat transfer of a nanofluid is numerically examined
   in a two dimensional microchannel filled by a porous media. Present
   nanofluid consists of the functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes
   suspended in water which are enough stable through the base fluid. The
   homogenous mixture is in the thermal equilibrium which means provide a
   single phase substance. The porous media is considered as a
   Darcy-Forchheimer model. Moreover the slip velocity and temperature jump
   boundary conditions are assumed on the microchannel horizontal sides
   which mean the influences of permeability and porosity values on theses
   boundary conditions are presented for the first time at present work. To
   do this, the wide range of thermo physical parameters are examined as
   like Da = 0.1 to 0.001, Re = 10,100, dimensionless slip coefficient from
   0.001 to 0.1 at different mass fraction of nanoparticles. It is observed
   that less Darcy number leads to more local Nusselt number and also
   applying the porous medium corresponds to higher slip velocity.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of the present study is to assess the heat transfer
   efficiency of Al2O3-MWCNT/thermal oil hybrid nanofluid over different
   temperatures (25-50 degrees C) and solid concentrations (0.125\%-1.5\%).
   To this end, first of all, the stability of the nano-oil has been
   studied through the Zeta potential analysis. Then, the dynamic viscosity
   and thermal conductivity of the nanofluid have been experimentally
   investigated. It was found that the nanofluid showed Newtonian behavior
   over the studied range of temperatures and solid concentrations. The
   dynamic viscosity showed increasing trend as the solid concentration
   increased. It is found that the minimum increase in dynamic viscosity is
   at the temperature of 50 degrees C in all the studied solid
   concentrations except 0.5\% and 1\%. As for the thermal conductivity, it
   showed increasing trend as the temperature and solid concentration
   increased. The maximum enhancement was at the temperature of 50 degrees
   C and solid concentration 1.5\% by approximately 45\%. Based on the
   experimental data, two new highly precise correlations to predict the
   dynamic viscosity and thermal conductivity of the studied nanofluid have
   been proposed. Moreover, the heat transfer efficiency of the nano fluid
   has been evaluated based on different figures of merit. It is revealed
   that using this nanofluid instead of the base fluid can be beneficial in
   all the studied solid concentrations and temperatures for both the
   internal laminar and turbulent flow regimes except the solid
   concentrations of 1 and 1.5\% in internal turbulent flow regimes. The
   effect of adding nanoparticles on pumping power and convective heat
   transfer coefficient has also been theoretically investigated. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{In this paper, a mathematical model has been formulated to predict the
   performance of single and double effect solar still by using modified
   heat and mass transfer correlations. Two similar experimental
   desalination units (single and double effect) were designed to validate
   the mathematical model. The production of a solar still is strongly
   influenced by latent heat reuse and increase the temperature difference
   between the water and condensing surface. The results showed that the
   separation of condensing surface and solar energy receiving surface
   would result in enhancement of 94\% for daily production compared to
   conventional one. Moreover, by reusing the latent heat the total yield
   of double effect showed a 70\% increase with respect to a single effect.
   Increasing the power input from 200 to 500 a led to 236\% and 240\%
   production increase for single and double effect, respectively.
   Furthermore, raising the water depth from 1 to 3 cm resulted in 14\% and
   26\% decrease in the daily production rate of single and double effect

   proposed to predict the viscosity and thermal conductivity ratio of the
   nanofluid using experimental data. Then, the relative values of pressure
   drop and heat transfer coefficient were calculated by employing proposed
   correlations. Results revealed that the ratio of pressure drop decreased
   with increasing shear rate while increased with increasing solid volume
   fraction and temperature. Therefore, F-MWCNTs/EG-water nanofluid was
   more suitable for applications with higher shear rates. In addition, the
   ratio of heat transfer coefficient increased with augmentation of solid
   volume fraction and temperature. This ratio improved to 44\%, which
   corresponded to the volume fraction of 1\% and the temperature of 50
   degrees C. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, functionalized single walled carbon nanotubes (FSWCNTs)
   were suspended in Ethylene Glycol (EG) at different volume fractions. A
   KD2 pro thermal conductivity meter was used to measure the thermal
   conductivity in the temperature range from 30 to 50 degrees C.
   Nanofluids were prepared in solid volume fraction of 0.02, 0.05, 0.075,
   0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and, 0.75\%. Experimental results revealed that the
   thermal conductivity of the nanofluid is a non-linear function of
   temperature and SWCNTs volume fraction in the range of this
   investigation. Thermal conductivity increases with temperature and
   nanoparticles volume fraction as usual for this type of nanofluid.
   Maximum increment in thermal conductivity of the nanofluids was found to
   be about 45\% at 0.75 vol fractions loading at 50 degrees C. Finally, a
   new correlation based on artificial neural network (ANN) approach has
   been proposed for SWCNT-EG thermal conductivity in terms of
   nanoparticles volume fraction and temperature using the experimental
   data. Used ANN approach has estimated the experimental values of thermal
   conductivity with the absolute average relative deviation lower than
   0.9\%, mean square error of 3.67 x 10(-5) and regression coefficient of
   0.9989. Comparison between the suggested techniques with various used
   correlation in the literatures established that the ANN approach is
   better to other presented methods and therefore can be proposed as a
   useful means for predicting of the nanofluids thermal conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a two-stage method, along with an ultrasonic device, a
   magnetic mixture, and acidity control technique were used to produce
   ZnO-Ag/water nanofluid and the test results, along with results from
   data analysis are presented by diagrams and tables. The effect of volume
   fraction (0.125-2\%) and temperature (25-50 degrees C) on thermal
   conductivity of nanofluid was examined on thermal conductivity of a
   hybrid nanofluid, i.e. zinc oxide silver ZnO-Ag (50\%-50\%), is
   presented in a diagram. At the end, a model was proposed for calculating
   thermal conductivity of the nanofluid, based on existing data. The
   results show that since Brownian motion increases with raising
   temperature, an increase in volume fraction at higher temperatures has a
   greater role in increasing thermal conductivity. In low volume
   fractions, temperature has a weaker effect on thermal conductivity. We
   found that the highest relative thermal conductivity was observed in
   volume fraction of 2\% at 50 degrees C. Also, according to the obtained

Abstract = {{Emissions from motorcycles are well known to be a serious cause of
   environmental pollution. One of the most effective ways to reduce the
   emissions during cold start of the motorcycle engine is using
   electrically heated catalytic converters (EHC). In this study, a kinetic
   model has been developed by using CFD methods to investigate the effects
   of using EHC on CO emission from motorcycle engines. Apart from three
   different heating temperatures (600, 800 and 1000 K), the other studied
   parameters included the heating position (the inlet and the mid-section
   of the catalyst converter) and heating duration (20, 25 and 35 s).
   Results showed that using the heater at the inlet of the catalytic
   converter is more effective than when it is in mid-section and the
   converter has a higher reaction performance. Moreover, the results
   indicated that the minimum heating temperature which required the
   converter to reach the light-off point is 450 K. In addition, the
   results revealed that when the heaters were turned on prior to cold
   starting the engine for duration of 35 s, the higher CO conversion
   occurs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nanofluid flow is considered one of the most important solutions for
   improving heat transfer systems. In this study, an isotherm heat
   transfer system has been designed and built in order to investigate the
   effect of utilizing water/graphene oxide nanofluid flow on heat transfer
   and the friction coefficient in a circular profile copper tube. The
   range of nanofluid concentration is considered as 0\%, 0.025\%, 0.05\%,
   0.075\%, and 0.1\% of volume fraction and Reynolds number of the
   turbulent flow is chosen between 5250 and 36,500. The nanofluid is made
   through a two-step method. The absolute value of Zeta potential equals
   41 mV, which is measured experimentally and shows acceptable stability.
   The thermal conductivity of nanofluid has a maximum of 28\% increase in
   comparison to the base fluid. Considering the experiential data from
   this study, the Nusselt number, the convective heat transfer
   coefficient, the pressure loss, the friction factor, and the coefficient
   of performance are investigated. In order to achieve validation, the
   results of this study are compared with former studies. Maximally, the
   nanofluid has a 40.3\% augmentation in the convective heat transfer
   coefficient in comparison to the base fluid. In addition, a minor
   augmentation takes place during pressure loss and friction coefficient
   by utilizing the nanofluid that reaches a maximum of 16\%. However, the
   thermal performance coefficient maximally increases by 1.148. According
   to the achieved results, the present nanofluid can be used in coolant
   systems like air cooling heat exchangers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents an investigation of the boiling heat transfer of
   iron oxide/de-ionized water nanofluid on a flat copper surface under
   atmospheric pressure. Measurements were conducted to evaluate the
   effects of nanofluid concentration, surface type, surface roughness,
   sedimentation thickness, and heat flux on the roughness of the surface
   after boiling experiments. For this purpose, the effect of sedimentation
   of the nanofluid on both the smooth and the rough surfaces on the
   boiling heat transfer of the nano fluid was investigated through some
   experiments. Results showed that after the boiling test on the rough
   surface, boiling heat transfer of nanofluids reduced at low heat fluxes,
   while it increased in high heat fluxes. Moreover, after the boiling test
   on the smooth surface, boiling heat transfer of nanofluids increased at
   low heat fluxes, while it did not change in high heat fluxes. Results
   also indicated that the effects of surface deposition were more evident
   at high nanofluid concentrations. Furthermore, for rough surfaces with
   high heat flux and smooth surfaces with low heat flux, it was observed
   that boiling heat transfer can be increased by making a deposit on the

Abstract = {{Al2O3 nanofluids flow has been studied in etched glass micromodel which
   is idealization of porous media by using a pseudo 2D Lattice Boltzmann
   Method (LBM). The predictions were compared with experimental results.
   Pressure drop / flow rate relations have been measured for pure water
   and Al2O3 nanofluids. Because the size of Al2O3 nanoparticles is tiny
   enough to permit through the pore throats of the micromodel, blockage
   does not occur and the permeability is independent of the nanofluid
   volume fraction. Therefore, the nanofluid behaves as a single phase
   fluid, and a single phase LBM is able to simulate the results of this
   experiment. Although the flow in micromodels is 3D, we showed that 2D
   LBM can be used provided an effective viscous drag force, representing
   the effect of the third dimension, is considered. Good qualitative and
   quantitative agreement is seen between the numerical and experimental
   results.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of using water/graphene oxide nanofluid as a working fluid on
   heat transfer and pressure drop was studied experimentally. For this
   purpose, subsonic wind tunnel and a closed heat transfer cycle were used
   at the same time. The effect of different concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.1,
   0.2\% by volume) of water/-graphene oxide nanofluid at different
   Reynolds numbers in a tube under air cross-flow was evaluated in wind
   tunnel tests. The range of Reynolds number of the flow around the tube
   was between 3800 and 21500 (3800 <= Re-o <= 21500). The friction factor
   of the nanofluid flow inside the tube and the mean Nusselt number of the
   external air flow around the copper tube were calculated by measuring
   the variables. Results showed that by using water/graphene oxide
   nanofluid, the average Nusselt number enhanced by up to 51.4\% compared
   to pure water. The use of nanofluid increased the friction factor by
   21\% in comparison with pure water. Because of changes in heat transfer
   and friction factor, heat transfer performance coefficient increased by
   up to 42.2\%, indicating enhanced heat transfer compared to undesirable
   pressure drop in the test. According to the results, this nanofluid can
   be a good alternative in similar applications such as heat exchangers.

Abstract = {{The present paper studies the geometric optimization of a fin plate
   under free heat transfer convection using the constructal theory. In
   order to check this mode, certain factors are considered, including
   temperature, heating plate dimensions, and the mass of the materials
   used for constructing the fins. The used fins are rectangular and the
   supposed fluid of the environment is air. The main goal here is to
   determine the role of the arrangement type of the fins in terms of
   geometric optimization for cooling of the heating plate. In so doing,
   two types of arrangements have been considered longitudinal and
   transverse and the solution steps are carried out separately for each
   arrangement. First, the optimization was studied using the analytical
   solution via the intersection of asymptotes. Then, in order to validate
   the analytical method used on the basis of the constructal theory, the
   numerical method was used for numerical simulation of the work. The
   results were finally compared and the best and most efficient possible
   construct for fin arrangement were selected. This optimal geometry in
   the longitudinal arrangement was achieved with six fins and a heat
   transfer rate of 34.47 W. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{118}},
Pages = {{12-23}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the investigation of laminar natural convection in
   3D vertical cylindrical annulus containing electrically conductive
   fluids under a horizontal magnetic field. The model was composed of two
   isothermal coaxial cylinders. Both ends of the cylinders were supposed
   adiabatic and all walls were assumed electrically insulated. Complex
   nonlinear governing equations were solved numerically by means of the
   finite volume method. The effects of different parameters such as the
   strength of the magnetic field, the radii ratio, aspect ratio, and
   Prandtl number on the temperature distribution, average Nusselt number,
   distribution of Lorentz forces as well as induced electric field were
   investigated. Results showed that for aspect ratios lower than about 1,
   the average Nusselt number increased as aspect ratio was increased. When
   aspect ratio was greater than about 1, the average Nusselt number
   decreases as aspect ratio was enlarged. Moreover, results showed that
   the average Nusselt number increased as radii ratio was increased.
   Results also revealed that a stronger magnetic field was needed to
   achieve pure conduction in the case of thick annulus. The presence of
   magnetic field induced an electric field which affected the Lorentz
   force. Distributions of Lorentz force and induced electric field
   indicated respectively the formation of Hartmann and Roberts layers.
   Furthermore, the average Nusselt number increased with increasing
   Prandtl number at all Hartmann numbers. It was also found that with
   increasing Hartmann number, the effect of Prandtl number on the average
   Nusselt number decreased. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{In this experimental work, the antifreeze composed of 50 vol.\% water
   and 50 vol.\% ethylene glycol has been used as the base fluid. The
   functionalized single walled carbon nanotubes (F-SWCNTs) with different
   volume fractions (0.025, 0.055, 0.08, 0.125, 0.25, 0.53 and 0.65\%) have
   been suspended to the base fluid by ultrasonic waves. The KD2 Pro
   Thermal Properties Analyzer was employed to measure thermal conductivity
   of the prepared samples at different temperatures. Results showed that
   the thermal conductivity improves proportionally with augmenting the
   concentration and temperature. Measurements also indicated that in
   greater volume fractions (phi > 0.53\%), temperature rise has a greater
   influence on the nanofluids thermal conductivity. Since no valid and
   applicable correlation is available to predict the thermal conductivity
   of F-SWCNTs/EG-water nanofluid, a correlation has been offered for
   predicting the thermal conductivity of this nanofluid using experimental
   results. The maximum value of deviation boundary was 2.4\%. Finally,
   forced convective heat transfer in a smooth tube in absence and presence
   F-SWCNTs was investigated. Thermal performance of antifreeze (eta),
   defined as the ratio of heat transfer coefficient to pressure drop, was
   analyzed and results made a border for the use of present nanofluids.
   The argumentations indicated that the present nanofluid was efficient as
   long as relative viscosity is lower than the 0.465 power of the thermal
   conductivity ratio. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   of several nano-lubricant samples were measured at various shear rates
   and temperatures. Viscosity measurements at different shear rates
   revealed that all nano lubricant samples had Newtonian behavior. The
   results showed that the maximum increase in viscosity was 12\% that

   relative viscosity were also compared to previous theoretical and
   experimental works. The comparisons showed that the previous models are
   unable to predict the viscosity of ZnO-SAE50 nano-lubricant. Therefore,
   based on viscosity measurements, a new correlation as a function of ZnO

Abstract = {{Presets work aims to investigate the natural convection inside a
   cylindrical annulus mold containing molten gallium under a horizontal
   magnetic field in three-dimensional coordinates. The modeling system is
   a vertical cylindrical annulus which is made by two co-axial cylinders
   of internal and external radii. The internal and external walls are
   maintained isothermal but in different temperatures. The upper and lower
   sides of annulus are also considered adiabatic while it is filled by an
   electrical conducting fluid. Three dimensional cylindrical coordinates
   as (r, theta, z) are used to respond the velocity components as (u, v,
   w). The governing equations are steady, laminar and Newtonian using the
   Boussinesq approximation. Equations are nonlinear and they must be
   corresponded by applying the finite volume approach; so that the
   hybrid-scheme is applied to discretize equations. The results imply that
   magnetic field existence leads to generate the Lorentz force in opposite
   direction of the buoyancy forces. Moreover the Lorentz force and its
   corresponded electric field are more significant in both Hartmann layer
   and Roberts layer, respectively. The strong magnetic field is required

Abstract = {{In this paper, behavior of low concentration nanofluids (0.1\%, 0.5\%,
   2.5\% by vol.) is experimentally studied in a circular channel subjected
   to a constant heat flux. Two average particle sizes (10 and 20 nm) were
   also used. The local heat transfer coefficient is measured for
   water-based nanofluids containing oxide nanoparticles (TiO2, Al2O3, CuO)
   under the single phase regime and subcooled flow boiling conditions in a
   vertical channel. In single phase regime, it is found that the
   convective heat transfer coefficient enhances for nanofluids. Nucleate
   boiling augmented the rate of heat transfer. However, at the subcooled
   regime, the rate of heat transfer degrades for nanofluids and it
   degrades more by increasing concentration of nanoparticles. On the other
   hand, it can be seen the nanoparticle type has a small effect on this
   degradation, while the particle size has more effect on heat transfer
   coefficient variation. Comparisons with correlations present in
   literature are accomplished and a very good agreement is realized. (C)

Abstract = {{In this work, the flow boiling of TiO2/water and Al2O3/water nanofluids
   was investigated experimentally and simulated with two phases.
   Experimental results were obtained in two directions and compared
   together. The volume fraction and heat transfer coefficient obtained
   from the vertical tube were compared with those obtained from the
   horizontal tube. The results showed that the contours of vapor volume
   fraction in horizontal tube are completely different from the vertical
   tube, which is due to the buoyancy effect. Moreover, the effect of
   nanoparticles on both flow directions was almost the same, while heat
   transfer coefficient was not the same in these flow directions. Based on
   the experimental result, presence of nanoparticles in the base fluid
   cannot increase the heat transfer coefficient.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the steady state and laminar mixed convection of
   nanofluid in horizontal eccentric annulus with rotating inner cylinder
   has been investigated numerically. The inner and outer cylinders are
   considered at constant temperature T-i and T-o respectively, where T-i >
   T-o. The annular space is filled with Alumina-water nanofluid. The
   nonlinear governing equations and the associated boundary conditions in
   the polar coordinate are solved numerically using the finite volume
   method and SIMPLER algorithm. In order to perform the numerical
   simulations, a code has been written to model the problem using bipolar
   orthogonal co-ordinates as well as non-orthogonal co-ordinates grid
   types. It is worth mentioning that in non-orthogonal co-ordinates grid
   types the code is able to model the problem with or without the effects
   of non-orthogonality. Due to the inconsiderable non-orthogonality of the
   grid, difference between the results of three schemes is <3\%.
   Considering the computational cost, the code developed for
   non-orthogonal co-ordinates grid types without effects of
   non-orthogonality has been used for this study. The effects of the
   eccentricity and the nanoparticle volume fraction on the heat transfer
   inside the annuli have been investigated. According to the results, the
   average Nusselt number increases by increasing the downward eccentricity
   of the inner cylinder. Furthermore, the maximum average Nusselt number
   occurs for an optimal nanoparticle volume fraction. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, an experimental investigation on the effects of hybrid
   nano-additives, composed of magnesium oxide (MgO) and functionalized
   multi-walled carbon nanotubes (F1VIWCNTs), on the thermal conductivity
   of ethylene glycol (EG) is presented. The experiments performed at
   temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 50 degrees C and the solid
   volume fraction range of 0-0.6\%. The measurements revealed that the
   thermal conductivity of nanofluids significantly enhances with an
   increase in the percentage of the solid volume fraction. Moreover, the
   thermal conductivity of EG considerably increased with increasing
   temperature, while thermal conductivity of hybrid nanofluid slightly
   enhanced. The thermal conductivity measurements showed that the maximum
   enhancement of thermal conductivity of nanofluid is 21.3\%, which
   occurred at solid volume fraction of 0.6\% and temperature of 25 degrees
   C. Finally, efforts were made to provide an accurate correlation for
   estimating the thermal conductivity at various temperatures and
   concentrations. Deviation analysis of the thermal conductivity ratio was
   performed. The comparison between experimental results and correlation
   outputs showed a good agreement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Engine oil is a type of lubricants and coolants that is used in internal
   combustion engines. In this paper, an examination of viscosity of
   MWCNTs/ZnO-SAE40 hybrid nano-lubricants under various temperatures and
   solid volume fractions is presented. The experiments performed at
   temperature ranging from 25 degrees C to 60 degrees C and solid volume
   fractions of 0, 0.05\%, 0.075\%, 0.1\%, 0.2\%, 0.4\%, 0.5\%, 0.75\% and
   1\%. The results revealed that the nano-lubricant behaves as Newtonian
   fluid. Viscosity measurements also showed that the viscosity decreases
   with increasing temperature and increases with an enhancement in the
   solid volume fraction. Using experimental data, relative viscosity
   indicated that the maximum enhancement of viscosity of the
   nano-lubricant was 33.3\%. This occurred at solid volume fraction of
   1.0\% and temperature of 40 degrees C. Based on experimental results,
   the correlation has been proposed to estimate the viscosity of
   MWCNTs/ZnO-SAE40 hybrid nano-lubricants. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, the electrically conducting fluid flow inside a channel
   with local symmetric constrictions, in the presence of a uniform
   transverse magnetic field is investigated using Lattice Boltzmann Method
   (LBM). To simulate Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) flow, the extended model
   of D2Q9 for MHD has been used. In this model, the magnetic induction
   equation is solved in a similar manner to hydrodynamic flow field which
   is easy for programming. This extended model has a capability of
   simultaneously solving both magnetic and hydrodynamic fields; so that,
   it is possible to simulate MHD flow for various magnetic Reynolds number
   (Re-m). Moreover, the effects of Rem on the flow characteristics are
   investigated. It is observed that, an increase in Rem, while keeping the
   Hartman number (Ha) constant, can control the separation zone;
   furthermore, comparing to increasing Ha, it doesn't result in a
   significant pressure drop along the channel.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a thermal model for estimating the efficiency of a basin
   solar still with an external reflector was introduced using the energy
   balance equations of different parts of the solar still. Then, in order
   to verify the precision and accuracy of this model, a basin solar still
   with an external reflector was constructed and some experiments were
   performed. The hourly temperature values for different places of the
   still and amount of distilled water were calculated using the thermal
   model and compared with experimental measurements. Comparisons show that
   the thermal model of the still is in good agreement with the
   experimental results. Therefore, it can be concluded that the introduced
   thermal model can be used reliably to estimate the amount of distilled
   water and efficiency of the basin solar still with an external
   reflector. Results also revealed that the efficiency of the solar still
   is low in the early hours, while it was enhanced 44\% in the afternoon.
   Furthermore, it was concluded that the accumulated distilled water is
   4600 mL/day and 4300 mL/day for theoretical and experimental

Abstract = {{In this paper, the thermal conductivity ratio of MgO-MWCNTs/EG hybrid
   nanofluids has been predicted by an optimal artificial neural network at
   solid volume fractions of 0.05\%, 0.1\%, 0.15\%, 0.2\%, 0.4\% and 0.6\%
   in the temperature range of 25-50 degrees C. In this way, at the first,
   thirty six experimental data was presented to determine the thermal
   conductivity ratio of the hybrid nanofluid. Then, four optimal
   artificial neural networks with 6, 8,10 and 12 neurons in hidden layer
   were designed to predict the thermal conductivity ratio of the
   nanofluid. The comparison between four optimal ANN results and
   experimental showed that the ANN with 12 neurons in hidden layer was the
   best model. Moreover, the results obtained from the best ANN indicated
   the maximum deviation margin of 0.8\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper includes an experimental study on rheological behavior of
   hybrid nanofluids made of iron (Fe) and copper oxide (CuO) in a binary
   mixture of water and ethylene glycol. Nanofluid samples, with solid
   volume fractions of 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 1.5\%, were prepared by
   dispersing an equal volumes of Fe and CuO nanoparticles in a binary
   mixture of water and ethylene glycol with the proportion of 20-80 vol.
   \%. Viscosity measurements were performed at temperatures ranging from
   25 degrees C to 50 degrees C and the shear rate range of 3.669-122.3
   s(-1) for all samples. Experimental findings revealed that the low
   concentration samples showed Newtonian behavior, while the high
   concentration samples had non-Newtonian behavior and followed the power
   law model. Moreover, the power law index and consistency index were
   obtained using curve-fitting on experimental shear stress-shear rate
   dependency. The curve-fitting results revealed that the power law index
   reduced to 0.36, indicating that the high concentration samples
   possessed shear-thinning behavior at all temperature considered. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, experimental determination of dynamic viscosity of water

   The results showed that the viscosity considerably decreases with

   increase in the solid volume fraction, remarkably. The calculated
   viscosity ratios showed that the maximum viscosity enhancement was
   129.7\%. Using experimental data, a new correlation has been proposed to
   predict the viscosity of magnetite nanofluid (Fe3O4/water). A comparison

Abstract = {{In this paper, the rheological behavior of engine oil containing various
   quantities of hybrid nano additives has been examined. The experiments
   were performed in the solid volume fraction range of 0-1.0\% and
   temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 50 degrees C. Viscosity
   measurements, at the shear rate range of 1333-13,333 s(-1), showed that
   Al2O3-MWCNTs/SAE40 hybrid nanofluid had a Newtonian behavior at all
   solid volume fractions and temperatures considered. Experimental results
   also indicated that the viscosity of the hybrid nanofluid increased with
   increasing nano-additives concentration and decreasing temperature.
   Results of relative viscosity of the hybrid nanofluid showed that the
   maximum augmentation of the viscosity was about 46\%. Results from
   sensitivity analysis of viscosity revealed that the viscosity
   sensitivity to temperature variation is minor, while it is more
   sensitive to the variations of solid volume fraction. Furthermore, an
   accurate correlation was proposed to predict the viscosity of the hybrid
   nanofluids for application in thermal engineering. Finally, the effects
   of nano-additives on the pumping power for the oil flow have been
   reported. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Regarding the viscosity of the fluids which is an imperative parameter
   for calculating the required pumping power and convective heat transfer,
   based on experimental data, an optimal artificial neural network was
   designed to predict the relative viscosity of multi-walled carbon
   nanotubes/water nanofluid. Solid volume fraction and temperature were
   used as input variables and relative viscosity was employed as output
   variable. Accurate and efficient artificial neural network was obtained
   by changing the number of neurons in the hidden layer. The dataset was
   divided into training and test sets which contained 80 and 20\% of data
   points respectively. The results obtained from the optimal artificial
   neural network exhibited a maximum deviation margin of 0.28\%.
   Eventually, the ANN outputs were compared with results obtained from the
   previous empirical correlation and experimental data. It was found that
   the optimal artificial neural network model is more accurate compared to
   the previous empirical correlation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, simulation of Poiseuille flow within nanochannel
   containing Copper and Platinum particles has been performed using
   molecular dynamic (MD). In this simulation LAMMPS code is used to
   simulate three-dimensional Poiseuille flow. The atomic interaction is
   governed by the modified Lennard Jones potential. To study the wall
   effects on the surface tension and density profile, we placed two solid
   walls, one at the bottom boundary and the other at the top boundary. For
   solid liquid interactions, the modified Lennard Jones potential function
   was used. Velocity profiles and distribution of temperature and density
   have been obtained, and agglutination of nanoparticles has been
   discussed. It has also shown that with more particles, less time is
   required for the particles to fuse or agglutinate. Also, we can conclude
   that the agglutination time in nanochannel with Copper particles is
   faster that in Platinum nanoparticles. Finally, it is demonstrated that
   using nanoparticles raises thermal conduction in the channel. (C) 2016

   with constant strength of B-0. High temperature nano-fluid (T-H) enters
   the micro-channel and exposed to its cold walls. Slip velocity boundary
   condition along the walls of the micro-channel is considered. Governing
   equations are numerically solved using FORTRAN computer code based on
   the SIMPLE algorithm. Results are presented as the velocity,
   temperature, and Nusselt number profiles. Greater Reynolds number,
   Hartmann number, and volume fraction related to more heat transfer rate;

   nanofluid is presented. The experiments were carried out for solid
   volume fraction range of 0 to 23\% in temperatures ranging from 25
   degrees C to 50 degrees C. The results revealed that the thermal
   conductivity ratio enhances with increasing the solid volume fraction
   and temperature. Results also showed that, at higher temperatures, the
   variation of thermal conductivity ratio with solid volume fraction was
   more than that at lower temperatures. Moreover, the effect of
   temperature on the thermal conductivity ratio was more noticeable at
   higher solid volume fractions. The thermal conductivity measurements
   also showed that the maximum thermal conductivity ratio was 30\%, which
   occurred at temperature of 50 degrees C for solid volume fraction of
   2.3\%. Finally, for engineering applications, based on experimental
   results, a precise correlation was suggested to predict the thermal

Abstract = {{In this paper, at first, a new correlation was proposed to predict the
   relative viscosity of MWCNTs-SiO2/AE40 nano-lubricant using experimental
   data. Then, considering minimum prediction error, an optimal artificial
   neural network was designed to predict the relative viscosity of the
   nano-lubricant. Forty-eight experimental data were used to feed the
   model. The data set was derived to training, validation and test sets
   which contained 70\%, 15\% and 15\% of data points, respectively. The
   correlation outputs showed that there is a deviation margin of 4\%. The
   results obtained from optimal artificial neural network presented a
   deviation margin of 1.5\%. It can be found from comparisons that the
   optimal artificial neural network model is more accurate compared to
   empirical correlation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Investigation of heat transfer performance and friction factor of a
   counter-flow double-pipe heat exchanger using nitrogen-doped,

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS IN HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{76}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Nitrogen-doped graphene (NDG) nanofluids are prepared using a two-step
   method in an aqueous solution of 0.025 wt.\% Triton X-100 as a
   surfactant with various nanosheets at several concentrations (0.01,
   0.02, 0.04, 0.06 wt.\%). This paper reports results of experiments on
   thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and viscosity of the NDG
   nanofluids, as well as their convective heat transfer behavior flowing
   in a double-pipe heat exchanger. To assess the thermal properties, we
   used various water-based nanofluids as coolants to analyze the total
   heat transfer coefficient, convective heat transfer coefficient, the
   percentage of wall temperature reduction, pressure drop, and pumping
   power in a counter-flow double-pipe heat exchanger. A novel MATLAB code
   carried out the calculations for Reynolds numbers between 5000 and
   15,000 (turbulent flow) and nanosheet weight percentages between 0.00\%
   and 0.06\%. An increase in Reynolds number or the percentage of
   nanomaterial could perhaps enhance the heat transfer of the working
   fluid. As an example, using 0.06 wt.\% nanomaterial in the base fluid
   led to 15.86\% enhancement of the convective heat transfer coefficient
   in comparison with water. Nonetheless, the penalty in terms of the rise
   in the pumping power was rather small. For a particular material,
   increasing Reynolds number or nanomaterial weight percentage would
   augment pumping power. Power consumption, heat removal, and heat
   transfer rate were greater for nanofluids than for water in all
   investigated cases, for a particular pumping power. The average increase
   in heat transfer coefficient was nearly 16.2\%. As a result, choosing
   NDG/water as the working fluid can improve the performance of
   double-pipe heat exchangers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   results indicated that the nano-lubricant exhibit Newtonian behavior at

Abstract = {{In the present study, the dynamic viscosity of alumina-engine oil
   nanofluid in different solid volume fractions and temperatures was
   experimentally investigated. The nanofluid samples were prepared in the
   solid volume fractions of 0.25\%, 0.5\%, 0.75\%, 1\%, 1.5\% and 2\%
   under the temperature range of 5 to 65 degrees C. The measurements were
   carried out by CAP 2000 + Viscometer, supplied by Brookfield of the USA.
   Using the experimental data, new correlations for predicting the dynamic
   viscosity of alumina-engine oil at different temperatures were proposed.
   The experiment results at different shear rates showed that all
   nanofluid samples exhibit the Newtonian behavior. The results also
   revealed that the viscosity of the nanofluid increases with the solid
   volume fraction. Moreover, it has been found that with increasing
   temperature, the viscosity of nanofluids decreases, and it was more
   tangible at the lower temperatures. The comparison between experimental
   findings and theoretical models showed that these models failed to
   predict the correct values of the viscosity of the nanofluids at all
   solid volume fractions. The experimental data also indicated that the
   maximum viscosity enhancement of nanofluid was 132\% compared with that
   of base fluid. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate artificial neural network (ANN) model and new correlation
   are developed to predict thermal conductivity of functionalized carbon
   nanotubes (IVIWNT-10 nm in diameter)-water nanofluid based on
   experimental data. Experimental values of thermal conductivity are in

   temperatures were changed within 10-60 degrees C. In order to estimate
   the thermal conductivity, a feed forward three-layer neural network is
   utilized. The obtained results exhibited that the new correlation and
   ANN model have a good agreement with the experimental data. The maximum
   values of deviation and mean square error of neural network outputs were
   2\% and 82E-05, respectively. The findings illustrated that the
   artificial neural network can estimate and model the thermal
   conductivity of CNTs-water nanofluid very efficiently and accurately.

Abstract = {{In this paper, an experimental investigation on the effects of
   temperature and nanotubes concentration on the thermal conductivity of
   MWCNTs/EG-water (40:60 vol.\%) nanofluids is presented. The experiments
   were performed at temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 50 degrees C
   and solid volume fraction range of 0-1.0\%. They showed that the thermal
   conductivity ratio enhances with increasing the solid volume fraction
   and temperature. Moreover, at higher concentration of MWCNTs, the effect
   of temperature on the thermal conductivity ratio was more tangible. The
   thermal conductivity measurements also indicated that the maximum
   enhancement of thermal conductivity of nanofluid was 34.7\%, which
   occurred at solid volume fraction of 1.0\% and temperature of 50 degrees
   C. The experimental results were compared with data obtained from
   Maxwell model. Since, this model failed to predict the thermal
   conductivity of the nano fluid, for engineering applications, using
   experimental findings, an accurate correlation was presented to predict
   the thermal conductivity of MWCNTs/EG-water (40:60 vol.\%) nanofluids.
   The maximum value of the deviation was obtained +/- 1.8\% for the
   proposed correlation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the thermal conductivity of Fe3O4 magnetic nanofluids has
   been investigated experimentally. The nanofluid samples were prepared
   using a two-step method by dispersing Fe3O4 nanoparticles into the water
   with the solid volume fractions of 0.1\%, 0.2\%, 0.4\%, 1\%, 2\% and
   3\%. Thermal conductivity measurements were performed by employing a KD2
   Pro thermal properties analyser under temperatures ranging from 20
   degrees C to 55 degrees C. Then, using experimental data, a new
   correlation was proposed to predict the thermal conductivity ratio of
   the magnetic nanofluid. Finally, an optimal artificial neural network
   was designed to predict the thermal conductivity ratio of the magnetic
   nanofluid. The experimental results indicated that the maximum
   enhancement of thermal conductivity of nanofluid was about 90\%, which
   occurred at solid volume fraction of 3.0\% and temperature of 55 degrees
   C. The comparative results showed that there are deviations of 5\% and
   1.5\%, respectively, for correlation and ANN from the experimental data.
   It was found from comparisons that the optimal artificial neural network
   model is more accurate compared to empirical correlation. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The hybrid nanofluids are novel nanofluids and can be prepared by
   suspending various kinds of nanoparticles in base fluid. In this paper,
   an experimental investigation on the effects of temperature and
   nanoparticles concentration on the thermal conductivity of ZnO-TiO2/EG
   hybrid nanofluids is presented. The experiments were implemented at
   temperature ranging from 25 to 50 A degrees C and solid volume fraction
   range of 0-3.5 \%. Experiments indicate that the thermal conductivity
   enhances with increasing the solid volume fraction and temperature. It
   was found that the variation of thermal conductivity enhancement of
   nanofluids with solid volume fraction at higher temperatures is greater
   than that at lower temperature. Moreover, it can be also seen that the
   variation of thermal conductivity enhancement of nanofluids with
   temperature at higher solid volume fraction is more than that at lower
   solid volume fraction. Finally, based on experimental data, in order to
   predict the thermal conductivity ratio of ZnO-TiO2/EG hybrid nanofluids,
   a correlation was proposed. Deviation analysis of the thermal
   conductivity ratio was also performed. Comparison between experimental
   data and the proposed correlation outputs revealed that this correlation
   has a good accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Forced convection of water-Cu nanofluid in a two-dimensional
   microchannel is studied numerically. The microchannel wall is divided
   into three parts. The entry and exit ones are kept insulated while the
   middle one has more temperature than the inlet fluid. The whole of
   microchannel is under the influence of a magnetic field with uniform
   strength of B-0. Slip velocity and temperature jump are involved along
   the microchannel walls for different values of slip coefficient such as
   B=0.001, B=0.01, and B=0.1 for Re=10, Re=50, and Re=100. Navier-Stokes
   equations are discretized and numerically solved by a developed computer
   code in FORTRAN. Results are presented as the velocity, temperature, and
   Nusselt number profiles. Moreover, the effect of magnetic field on slip
   velocity and temperature jump is investigated for the first time in the

   fraction correspond to more heat transfer rate; however, the effects of

Abstract = {{In this work, the estimation of thermal conductivity of Al2O3
   nanoparticles in water (40\%)-ethylene glycol (60\%) has been
   investigated. An empirical relationship has been proposed based on
   experimental data and in terms of temperature and volume fraction.
   Besides, a model has been presented using feedforward multi-layer
   perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN). The presented
   correlation relationship estimates empirical data very well. However,
   artificial neural network has a higher regression coefficient and lower
   error compared to the presented relationship. After examining different
   structures of neural network with different transfer functions, a
   structure was selected with two hidden layers and 5 neurons in the first
   and second layers and tangent sigmoid transfer function for both layers.
   The results indicate that artificial neural networks can precisely
   estimate the experimental data of thermal conductivity of Al2O3/water

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of temperature and
   solid volume fraction on thermal conductivity of CNTs-Al2O3/water
   nanofluids. Both Al2O3 nanoparticles and CNTs are dispersed in the base
   fluid with equal solid volume. Experiments were conducted with various
   solid volume fractions of 0.02, 0.04, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.0 \% and
   various fluid temperatures of 303, 314, 323 and 332 K. Measured data
   reveal that the thermal conductivity of nanofluid highly depends on the
   solid volume fraction. Also, temperature may play an important role in
   enhancing thermal conductivity of CNTs-Al2O3/water, especially at high
   solid volume fractions. Based on experimental data, correlations are
   proposed for different temperatures by nonlinear regression. These
   correlations are able to predict thermal conductivity of nanofluid with
   high precision. Besides, a general correlation of thermal conductivity
   with function of temperature and solid volume fraction was proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Weld geometry is a critical factor for determining the quality of
   Ti6Al4V welded joints. The size of the weld cross section profile has
   been quantitatively investigated through experimental and numerical
   analysis. Due to the difficulties in temperature measuring of the molten
   pool region, the temperature distribution through numerical simulation
   was exerted as an indirect approach for estimating the size of the melt
   pool profile and HAZ region. Moreover, the numerical model was used for
   prediction of cooling rate in the melt pool and thereby characterization
   of fusion zone microstructure. To achieve an accurate prediction of the
   weld geometry at low time and cost, the process was simulated based on
   artificial neural network. Different ANNs were developed for progressive
   prediction of the weld pool temperature distribution and weld geometry.
   Two feed-forward back propagation neural network models with 11 and 14
   neurons were developed to predict optimum process parameters. The
   proposed artificial neural network models perfectly predicted the
   process with mean square errors of 0.079 and 0.063. The results
   indicated that ANN outputs were in good agreement with the experimental
   and numerical data. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of standard Lattice Boltzmann, LB, is confined to the
   micro scale flows with a Knudsen number, Kn, less than 0.1. In the
   previous works we proposed a modified LB which is able to extend the
   ability of LBM to simulate wide range of Knudsen flow regimes. To study
   the ability of this model for porous media, in the present work we
   investigate nanoscale gaseous flows through porous media confined
   between parallel plates by means of LB, and molecular dynamics, MD,
   simulations. The comparison between modified LB and MD shows a very good
   agreement at sufficiently low solid fractions. In addition, flow
   characteristics through various porous structures are studied via the MD
   simulation and the effect of various parameters such as driving force,
   porosity and Knudsen number on the velocity and temperature
   distributions is investigated. Our results demonstrate the good ability
   of MDS for investigating different flow phenomena such as permittivity
   and Darcian flow in porous media. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{In the present study, natural convection heat transfer inside a
   trapezoidal enclosure filled with carbon nanotube-EG-water nanofluid
   using variable properties has been numerically investigated. The bottom
   and top walls of trapezoidal enclosure are kept at constant temperatures
   T-h and T-c, respectively, while the side walls of the cavity are
   thermally insulated. Using the finite volume method and the SIMPLER
   algorithm, the governing equations have been discretized. Simulations
   have been carried out for different aspect ratios, Rayleigh numbers of
   10(3)-10(6) as well as solid volume fractions of 0.0015, 0.03, and
   0.045. The results show that at low Rayleigh number (Ra <= 104), the
   average Nusselt number Nu(Avg) decreases with increasing the inclination
   angle (aspect ratio) at all solid volume fractions. While for Ra =
   10(6), the NUAvg increases and then decreases with inclination angle
   (aspect ratio) with maximum Nu(Avg) occurring at gamma = 30. Moreover,
   Nu(Avg) increases with increasing Rayleigh number at fixed inclination
   angle (aspect ratio) and solid volume fraction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on designing an artificial neural network which can
   predict thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity of ferromagnetic
   nanofluids from input experimental data including temperature, diameter
   of particles, and solid volume fraction. The experimental data were
   extracted and they were used as learning dataset to train the neural
   network. To find a proper architecture for network, an iteration method
   was used. Based on the results, there was no over-fitting in designed
   neural network and the neural network was able to track the data. ANN
   outputs showed that the maximum errors in predicting thermal
   conductivity and dynamic viscosity are 2\% and 2.5\%, respectively.
   Based on the ANN outputs, two sets of correlations for estimating the
   thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity were presented. The
   comparisons between experimental data and the proposed correlations
   showed that the presented correlations were in an excellent agreement
   with experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Laminar steady magneto-natural convection in a vertical cylindrical
   annulus formed by two coaxial cylinders filled with liquid potassium is
   studied numerically. The cylindrical walls are isothermal, and the other
   walls are assumed to be adiabatic. A constant horizontal magnetic field
   is also applied on the enclosure. The results show that flow is
   axisymmetric in the absence of the magnetic field; but by applying the
   horizontal magnetic field, it becomes asymmetric. This is due to the
   growth of Roberts and Hartmann layers near the walls parallel and normal
   to the magnetic field, respectively. The applied magnetic field results
   in a reduction in the Nusselt number in most of the regions of the
   annulus. This reduction is high in the Hartmann layers but low in the
   Roberts layers. Moreover, it was found that for a given value of Hartman
   number, the average Nusselt number is greater in the case of solving the
   electric potential equation. The results show that there is a large
   difference in the Nusselt number obtained by solving the electric
   potential equation, compared with by neglecting the electric potential.

Abstract = {{The accuracy of soft computing technique was employed to predict the
   performance of micro- and nano-sized particle erosion in a 3-D 90
   degrees elbow. The process, capable of simulating the total and maximum
   erosion rate with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), was
   constructed. The developed ANFIS network was with three neurons in the
   input layer, and one neuron in the output layer. The inputs included
   particle velocity, particle diameter, and volume fraction of the copper
   particles. The size of these particles was selected in the range of 10
   nm to 100 mu m. Numerical simulations have been performed with
   velocities ranging from 5 to 20 m/s and for volume fractions of up to
   4\%. The governing differential equations have been discretized by the
   finite volume method for ANFIS training data extraction. The ANFIS
   results were compared with the CFD results using root-mean-square error
   (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2). The CFD results show that
   an improvement in predictive accuracy and capability of generalization
   can be achieved by the ANFIS approach. The following characteristics
   were obtained: ANFIS model can be used to forecast the maximum and total
   erosion rate with high reliability and therefore can be applied for
   practical purposes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an investigation on the thermal conductivity of
   nanofluids using experimental data, neural networks, and correlation for
   modeling thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of Mg(OH)(2)
   nanopartides with mean diameter of 10 nm dispersed in ethylene glycol
   was determined by using a KD2-pro thermal analyzer. Based on the
   experimental data at different solid volume fractions and temperatures,
   an experimental correlation is proposed in terms of volume fraction and
   temperature. Then, the model of relative thermal conductivity as a
   function of volume fraction and temperature was developed via neural
   network based on the measured data. A network with two hidden layers and
   5 neurons in each layer has the lowest error and highest fitting
   coefficient. By comparing the performance of the neural network model
   and the correlation derived from empirical data, it was revealed that
   the neural network can more accurately predict the Mg(OH)(2)-EG
   nanofluids' thermal conductivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulation of natural convection of an
   electrically conducting fluid under the influence of a magnetic field in
   an inclined cylindrical annulus has been performed. The inner and outer
   cylinders are maintained at uniform temperatures and other walls are
   thermally insulated. The governing equations of this fluid system are
   solved by a finite volume (FV) code based on SIMPLER solution scheme.
   Detailed numerical results of heat transfer rate, Lorentz force,
   temperature and electric fields have been presented for a wide range of
   Hartmann number (0 <= Ha <= 60) and inclination angle (0 <= gamma <=
   90). The results indicate that a magnetic field can control the magnetic
   convection of an electrically conducting fluid. Depending on the
   direction and strength of the magnetic field, the suppression of
   convective motion was observed. For vertical cylindrical annulus,
   increasing the strength of the magnetic field causes the loss symmetry,
   and as the consequence, isotherms lose their circular shape. With
   increasing the Hartmann number the average Nusselt number approaches a
   constant value. For vertical annulus, the effect of Hartmann number on
   the average Nusselt number is not prominent compared to the case of
   horizontal annulus.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the thermal conductivity of CuO/EG-water nanofluid
   in different solid concentrations and temperatures has been
   experimentally investigated. Using a two-step method, the nanofluid has
   been produced in different solid concentrations ranging from 0.1\% to
   2\% and temperatures up to 50 degrees C. The thermal conductivity of the
   nanofluid has been experimentally measured using the KD2 Pro instrument.
   Based on the experimental data, new correlations for predicting the
   thermal conductivity of CuO/EG-water at different temperatures have been
   proposed. The results show that with the increase of the solid
   concentration, the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid increases.
   Furthermore, the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid increases while
   the temperature increases. This increase is by far more noticeable in
   higher solid concentrations compared with lower solid volume fraction.
   This means that it is the presence of nanoparticles in the base fluid
   that causes the increase of the effect of temperature on the thermal
   conductivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed-convection fluid flow and heat transfer in a square cavity filled
   with Al2O3-water nanofluid have been numerically investigated using the

   wall has a constant low temperature (T-c). The upper lid of the cavity
   moves in a positive direction. Effects of different key parameters such
   as Richardson number, position and height of the block, the volume
   fraction of the nanoparticles, and cavity inclination angles on the
   fluid flow and heat transfer inside the cavity are investigated. It is
   observed that the average Nusselt number for all ranges of solid volume
   fraction increases with a decrease in the Richardson number. The results
   elucidate irregular changes of mean Nusselt number at different

Abstract = {{In this article, the effect of a radial magnetic field on the steady,
   laminar and natural convection flow of molten potassium in a long
   horizontal annulus between two horizontal cylinders is investigated
   numerically. The inner and outer cylinders are at T-H and T-C

   on SIMPLER-algorithm is used to solve the governing equations of the
   model. Simulations are carried out for a wide range of the Rayleigh
   number (Ra), Hartmann number (Ha) and radii ratio (lambda). It is shown
   that for a given radii ratio as the strength of magnetic field
   increases, the convection heat transfer reduces. For narrow annulus, the
   effect of Hartmann number on the maximum absolute value of the stream
   function is not eminent compared to the case of high radii ratio.
   Furthermore it is found that for a given Ha and Ra, the average Nusselt
   number increases up to about lambda = 5 and then reduces gently as
   lambda enhances. Moreover, for all Hartmann numbers the effect of radii
   ratio on the average Nusselt number has almost the same trend.}},

Abstract = {{In the continuous casting process, natural convection occurs in mold
   containing a liquid metal. Natural convection in the melt causes the
   impurities to move and this phenomenon can lead to poor product.
   Therefore, by reducing natural convection, the quality of the product is
   improved. In this paper, 3D numerical simulation and multi-objective
   optimization of natural convection in a cylindrical annulus mold filled
   with molten potassium under a magnetic field is carried out. The inner
   and outer cylinders are maintained at uniform temperatures and other
   walls are thermally insulated. Two objective functions including the
   natural convection heat transfer rate (average Nusselt number) and
   magnetic field strength have been considered simultaneously. The
   multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO) has been
   employed. Four decision variables are the Hartmann number, inclination
   angle, and magnetic field angles. For the optimization process, the
   calculations of three-dimensional Navier-Stokes, energy, and electrical
   potential equations are combined with MOPSO. Using the numerically
   evaluated objective functions, the optimum frontier is estimated by a
   second order polynomial based on objective functions. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Magnetohydrodynamic natural convection fluid flow and heat transfer in a
   square enclosure with a pair of source and sink on its walls, filled
   with liquid Gallium fluid with Prandtl number of 0.02 has been
   investigated numerically. The heat source and heat sink are maintained
   at a constant temperature T-h and T-c, respectively with T-h > T-c. By
   variation of relative location of the heat source and sink on the walls
   of the enclosure, five different cases are generated. The governing
   equations written in terms of the primitive variables are solved
   numerically using the finite volume method and the SIMPLER algorithm.
   Using the developed code, a parametric study is performed, and the
   effects of the Rayleigh number, the Hartman number, and the locations of
   the source and sink on the fluid flow and heat transfer inside the
   enclosure are investigated. The results show that the flow and
   temperature distributions inside the enclosure are affected by the
   strength of the magnetic field, the Rayleigh number, and the relative
   location of the heat source and sink. The magnetic field decreases the
   rate of heat transfer, suppresses the convection heat transfer, and
   tends to slows down the flow velocity in the cavity. Moreover in some
   cases the magnetic field changes the flow pattern inside the enclosure.}},

Title = {{EFFECT OF NANOFLUID VARIABLE PROPERTIES ON MIXED CONVECTION FLOW AND

   HEATING ON SIDEWALLS}},

Abstract = {{In this study, mixed convection fluid flow and heat transfer in an
   inclined two-sided lid-driven cavity subjected to Al2O3-water nanofluid
   (with different particle diameters from 15 to 99 nm) has been
   investigated numerically. The geometry is a double lid-driven square
   cavity with sinusoidal temperature distribution on the left sidewall,
   while the right wall is kept at T. The top and bottom walls of the
   cavity, which move in opposite directions, are assumed to be insulated.
   The effects of inclination angle, Richardson number, nanoparticle volume
   fraction, temperature, and nanoparticle diameter based on recent
   variable property formulations are studied. The effects of an increase
   in Richardson number while the solid volume fraction is constant and
   effects of an increase in solid volume fraction when the Richardson
   number is kept constant are investigated. Also, the obtained results
   show that an increase in nanoparticle diameter influences the flow
   pattern and isotherm contours inside the cavity relatively when the
   Richardson number is kept constant and the diameter is varied from 15 to
   99 nm. As the mean nanoparticle diameter increases, the corresponding
   flow velocity decreases, and hence the heat transfer enhancement is
   reduced. The results indicate that as Richardson number increases, the
   average Nusselt number rapidly increases for different values of d(p).
   Moreover, the results have clearly indicated that the addition of Al2O3
   nanoparticles has produced a remarkable enhancement on heat transfer
   with respect to that of the pure fluid.}},

Title = {{NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTING FLUID FLOW AND FREE
   CONVECTIVE HEAT TRANSFER IN AN ANNULUS ON APPLYING A MAGNETIC FIELD}},
Journal = {{HEAT TRANSFER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},

Pages = {{749-766}},
Abstract = {{The presence of free convective heat transfer in an enclosure filled
   with a congealing melt leads to the output of a product with a
   nonuniform structure involving large grains. On applying a proper
   magnetic field to the melt in the enclosure, the convective flows are
   decreased and uniform and small grain structures are obtained. In this
   work, using the finite volume method, we investigated the application of
   a magnetic field to the convective heat transfer and temperature fields
   in steady and laminar flows of melted gallium in a long annulus between
   two horizontal cylinders at the Prandtl number 0.02. The inner and outer
   walls of the annulus are at T-C and T-H temperatures, respectively, with
   T-H > T-C. We also investigated the effect of the magnetic field
   intensity and the Hartmann number on the flow and temperature fields,
   the influence of the variation of other parameters, like the Rayleigh
   number, the angle of magnetic field application, the ratio of the inner
   to outer radii of the annulus on the flow and temperature field. It has
   been reveales that on changing the field angle to the horizon, the
   Nusselt number (Nu) is increased, which is of importance in a specific
   range of Hartmann numbers. Also with increase in the Rayleigh number,
   the change in Nu with the magnetic field intensity does not occur. In
   studying the influence of the outer radius to inner radius ratio on Nu
   at a fixed Rayleigh number, we have found that with increase in the
   diameter ratio, the Nu number increases.}},

   The numerical method used to solve the nonlinear governing equations of
   the problem is finite volume scheme. The computational results reveal
   that the effect of transverse magnetic field is more significant than
   that of the axial magnetic field on the average Nusselt number. Also, it
   is found that when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the axis of

   increase in Ha from 0 to 60.}},

Abstract = {{The periodic mixed convection of a water-copper nanofluid inside a
   rectangular cavity with aspect ratio of 3 is investigated numerically.
   The temperature of the bottom wall of the cavity is assumed greater than
   the temperature of the top lid which oscillates horizontally with the
   velocity defined as u = u(0) sin (omega t). The effects of Richardson
   number, Ri, and volume fraction of nanoparticles on the flow and thermal
   behaviour of the nanofluid are investigated. Velocity, temperature
   profiles, and streamlines are presented. It is observed that when Ri <
   1, heat transfer rate is much greater than when Ri > 1. The higher value
   of Ri corresponds to a lower value of the amplitude of the oscillation
   of Nu(m) in the steady periodic state. Moreover, increasing the volume
   fraction of the nanoparticles increases the heat transfer rate.}},
