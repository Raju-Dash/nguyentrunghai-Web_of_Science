Abstract = {{In this work, an initial value problem of Caputo-Katugampola (CK)
   fractional differential equations in fuzzy setting is considered and an
   idea of successive approximations under generalized Lipschitz condition
   is used to prove the existence and uniqueness results of the solution to
   the given problem. In order to obtain the above results, some necessary
   comparison theorems in real-valued differential equation under CK
   fractional derivative are established. Finally, a new technique to find
   analytical solutions of CK fuzzy fractional differential equations by
   using the solutions of fuzzy integer order differential equations is
   proposed. Some examples illustrating the applications of our results are
   presented. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical investigation is carried out to assess the hydrothermal
   performance of a water-based hybrid nanofluid containing both Fe3O4
   (magnetite) nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a heated tube
   in the presence of a constant non-uniform magnetic field. The magnetic
   field is created by three pairs of permanent magnets. The effects of
   Reynolds number, magnetite, and CNT volume concentrations as well as
   magnetic field strength are investigated. The acquired data for the case
   of without magnetic field confirmed higher values of heat transfer and
   pressure drop as a result of utilizing nanofluid compared with water.
   Additionally, it was found that the Nusselt number and pressure drop of
   the studied nanofluid samples increase significantly under the magnetic
   field. Moreover, the influence of magnetic field increases with an
   increase in the nanoparticle concentrations and magnetic field strength
   and decrease in the Reynolds number. The maximum increments of 109.31\%
   and 25.02\% in comparison with the case of without field were obtained
   in the average Nusselt number and pressure drop for hybrid nanofluid
   containing 0.9\% magnetite and 1.35\% CNT at Reynolds number of 500.}},

Abstract = {{Exploring the effect of nanoparticle shape on the fluid flow
   characteristics of boehmite alumina nanofluid in a horizontal
   double-pipe minichannel heat exchanger is the goal of this study. The
   proposed boehmite alumina nanofluid could consist of dispersed
   cylindrical, brick, blade, platelet, and spherical shape nanoparticles
   in a mixture of water/ethylene glycol. In this study, the water and
   nanofluid pass through the annulus and tube side of the heat exchanger,
   respectively. To accurately simulate the behavior of nanofluid, the two
   phase mixture model is utilized in the simulation. In this
   investigation, the effect of different Reynolds numbers, nanoparticle
   concentrations and shapes versus important hydrothermal properties are
   investigated. The results show that, the spherical and platelet shape
   lead to the highest and lowest performance index of heat exchanger,
   respectively. Moreover, it is found that the rates of heat transfer,
   overall heat transfer coefficient, pressure drop, and pumping power
   increases with increase in Reynolds number and nanoparticle
   concentration, while the opposite trend is observed for performance
   index of the heat exchanger. For instance, at the Reynolds number of 20
   000, by boosting the nanoparticle concentration from 0.5 to 2\%, the
   performance index for nanofluid containing platelet shape and spherical
   shape nanoparticles reduces by 130.63 and 3.88\%, respectively. (C) 2019

Journal = {{ENERGY}},

Pages = {{1088-1099}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Phase change material (PCM) based heat sink is an appropriate technique
   for electronic devices cooling. PCM-based heat sinks have a low overall
   thermal conductivity. Using vertical fins is a brilliant approach to
   tackle low thermal conductivity issue. The aim of this study is to
   present a correlation to estimate the optimum number of fins and optimum
   PCM volume fraction in a PCM-based heat sink. The objective function is
   defined as the longest safe operating time of the device prior to reach
   the critical temperature. The independent parameters are heat sink
   height, fin thickness and heat flux. Around 900 various geometries of
   heat sink in the height range of 10-30 mm, fin thickness range of
   0.2-0.5 mm were studied for two different input heat fluxes of 5000 and
   10000 W/m(2) to find the optimal number of fins. The analysis of
   variance was used to investigate the regression model reasonableness and
   find the main and interaction effects among the input parameters. The
   Results reveal that the optimal number of fins decreases by increasing
   the fin thickness. The increase in heat sink height results in higher
   optimal fin spacing, which consequently decreases the optimal number of
   fins. For a heat sink with constant width, a larger number of fins is
   required to prevent interfering with thermal performance, as the heat
   flux increases. The proposed correlations cover the Rayleigh number
   range of 3.3 x 10(6) <= Ra <= 5.4 x 10(8). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The use of an air-cooled micro-channel heat sink is becoming
   increasingly widespread to cool supercomputers. Passing air through
   micro-channels, which acts as an absorber, is the main heat transfer
   mechanism for cooling the main board of supercomputers. The present
   study aims to investigate the 3D flow of air on the performance of
   micro-channel heat sinks in which the channels can have five different
   configurations (e.g., circular, hexagonal, rectangular, triangular and a
   straight slot). The effect of the flow rate (Reynolds number) and inlet
   temperature of air on the Nusselt number, heat transfer coefficient,
   pressure drop and required pumping power were investigated. The results
   showed that among the five channel configurations, the triangular shape
   provides the highest thermal performance for cooling a specific
   micro-channel heat sink. However, with respect to manufacturing cost,
   the straight slot configuration is recommended. In the next stage, the
   effect of the manufacturing material was considered with respect to
   aluminum, alumina (92\%), cobalt, stainless steel, copper, and silver
   thermal conductivity. In the final stage, the effect of the air flow
   rate on the thermal stress and deformation of the geometry were studied,
   which provided that the coolant flow rate from 60 to 120 CFM prevents
   body failure. The results of this study could be helpful in the design
   of the cooling system of supercomputers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates a novel adaptive fuzzy fractional-order
   nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller (AFFO-NTSMC) for
   second-order nonlinear dynamic systems. The technique of fractional
   calculus and nonsingular terminal sliding mode control (NTSMC) are
   combined to establish fractional-order NTSMC (FO-NTSMC), in which a new
   fractional-order (FO) nonsingular terminal sliding mode (NTSM) surface
   is proposed. Then, a corresponding controller is designed to provide
   robustness, high performance control, finite time convergence in the
   presence of uncertainties and external disturbances. Furthermore, a
   fuzzy system with online adaptive learning algorithm is derived to
   eliminate the chattering phenomenon in conventional sliding mode control
   (SMC). The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously proven.
   Numerical simulation results are presented to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed control method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an analysis and optimization of new
   micro-displacement sensor for a compliant microgripper. This gripper is
   embedded with strain gauges at the flexure hinges to become a
   displacement sensor in the range of micrometer. In addition, this paper
   also presents an effective approach to enhance the first natural
   frequency of the microgripper. Specifically, the silicone rubber is used
   to fill the open cavities of the gripper in order to increase the
   stiffness, and as a result the frequency shows a relative improvement.
   It reveals that the gripper can realize the necessary displacement with
   the embedded sensor element. The stiffness of gripper can be reinforced
   by the rubber. As a result the frequency of the gripper is improved. The
   displacement and frequency are then optimized via using the differential
   evolution algorithm. The optimal result indicates that the gripper
   possesses an infinite fatigue life of 5.92 x 107 cycles for producing a
   large range of motion of 660 mu m and a frequency of 326 Hz. The
   prototype is fabricated via wire electrical discharged machining. The
   experimental results are in a good an agreement with the predicted and
   analyzed ones.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel adaptive finite-time control for robotic
   manipulators using terminal sliding mode control (TSMC) and radial basis

   approximate all parts of the system parameters through Ge-Lee (GL)
   matrix arid its product operators. Moreover, an error estimator is added
   to suppress the approximation errors of neural networks (NNs) and
   external disturbances. And then, an adaptive finite-time control law
   with a proper update law is designed to guarantee the occurrence of the
   sliding motion in finite time without relying on a priori knowledge of
   uncertainties and external disturbances. The stability and finite-time
