Abstract = {{Graphene-based efficient metasurface solar absorber is presented.
   Graphene monolayer sheet is integrated over silicon dioxide dielectric
   layer to improve the bandwidth and achieve maximum absorption in the
   visible region from 430 to 770 THz. Simulation results indicate that the
   average absorption of our graphene-based metasurface absorber is more
   than 84\% in the visible range. The absorber C-shape metasurface top
   layer placed above the graphene sheet is made up of tungsten material,
   and bottom layer made up of tungsten material helps in absorbing
   incoming electromagnetic light. The resonance frequency can be tuned in
   a wide frequency range by changing different physical parameters of
   proposed absorbers design. The absorption efficiency results of the
   proposed design are also compared with previously published similar
   absorber design to show the improvement of absorption in the proposed
   design. The proposed design is useful for designing next-generation
   graphene-based sensors and photovoltaic devices. Purposed graphene-based
   metasurface absorber can be used as a basic building block of solar
   energy-harvesting photovoltaic devices.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of coupled quantum wells to reduce electron
   overflow in InGaN/GaN dot-in-a-wire phosphor-free white color
   light-emitting diodes (white LEDs) and to improve the device
   performance. The light output power and external quantum efficiency
   (EQE) of the white LEDs with coupled quantum wells were increased and
   indicated that the efficiency droop was reduced. The improved output
   power and EQE of LEDs with the coupled quantum wells were attributed to
   the significant reduction of electron overflow primarily responsible for
   efficiency degradation through the near-surface GaN region. Compared to
   the commonly used AlGaN electron blocking layer between the device
   active region and p-GaN, the incorporation of a suitable InGaN quantum
   well between the n-GaN and the active region does not adversely affect
   the hole injection process. Moreover, the electron transport to the
   device active region can be further controlled by optimizing the
   thickness and bandgap energy of this InGaN quantum well. In addition, a
   blue-emitting InGaN quantum well is incorporated between the quantum dot
   active region and the p-Ga, wherein electrons escaping from the device
   active region can recombine with holes and contribute to white-light
   emission. The resulting device exhibits high internal quantum efficiency
   of 58.5\% with highly stable emission characteristics and virtually no
   efficiency droop. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of

Abstract = {{This article deals with the numerical simulation to examine the
   significant effects of MHD flow and nanoparticle migration inside a
   permeable space including two temperature model. For more physical
   situation, thermal radiation influence is considered. Viable
   transformation is assumed to alter the governing set of PDEs into
   dimensionless form. CVFEM was adopted to model this article. Impacts of
   radiation parameter, Rayleigh number (10(3) < Ra < 10(4)),
   nanofluid-solid interface factor (10 < Nhs < 1000), Hartmann number (0 <
   Ha < 20) and nanoparticles' shape (3 < m < 5.7) on nanofluid behavior
   were demonstrated. Outcomes depict that stronger convection can be
   obtained with augmenting in shape factor. Average Nusselt number
   increases as enhancing the buoyancy and radiation effect whereas
   decreases as enhancing nanofluid-solid interface factor and Hartmann
   number. Comparison of the numerical outputs achieved by means of CVFEM
   with published data was also deliberated. It is evident that the applied
   approach is very accurate to investigate solution of the discussed
   problem. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Support Vector Machine method is employed to predict the

Abstract = {{In this model, heat transfer analysis of water functionalized Fe3O4
   ferrofluid is performed along with the irreversibility process along a
   porous semi annulus. To determine the discrete behavior of the
   temperature distribution and ferrofluid flow inside the semi annulus, a
   non-Darcy approach is introduced for permeable media. To manage the
   movement of the powders, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) is applied normal to
   the surface of semi annulus. A complex nature system of nonlinear
   partial differential equation (PDE's) was developed along with the
   constraint defined at the surface of the annulus. Mathematical
   expression and thermophysical properties of both liquid and
   nanoparticles, respectively are introduced. Structure of this model has
   been solved though CVFEM and obtained the outputs against the emerging
   parameters namely: Hartmann number Ha, Rayleigh number Ra, Darcy numbers
   Da. All the obtained results defining the behavior of streamlines,
   isotherms, entropy generation, Bejan number and exergy loss contours.
   Obtained results portrays that disordered in the entire mechanism is
   more rapid by increasing the values of Darcy number however and exergy
   drop reduces but it depends upon the values of Hartmann number.}},

Abstract = {{The migration of ferrofluid particles due to an electric field within a
   porous space is examined. An algorithm was developed for CVFEM to solve
   the coupled equations. The properties of Fe3O4-ethylene glycol nanofluid
   are dependent on the electric field and on the shape of the
   nanoparticles. The energy equation seems more interesting in the
   presence of a radiative term. The influence of nanoparticles' shape,
   voltage, radiation parameter and Darcy number on nanofluid thermal
   behavior has been described. Average Nusselt number increases with
   expansion of the thermal radiation in the system. Enhancing the shape
   factor causes the Nusselt number to increase. The Darcy number yields
   more random patterns of isotherms.}},

Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{We here couple Nb2O5 with Fe2O3 to form visible-light active
   heterojunctions. The formed heterojunctions are responsive to visible
   light, and more importantly, photoactive for the mineralization of
   refractory organic compounds upon exposure to visible light. The
   sensitizer, Fe2O3, is found to govern the photocatalytic activity of the
   heterojunction. Therefore, the local structure of the sensitizer is
   investigated in-depth with X-ray absorption spectroscopy, including
   X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray
   absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Results show that the local structure
   of Fe2O3 is generally insensitive to the Fe2O3 loading amount, as
   confirmed by EXAFS. The lengths of the Fe-O coordination and Fe-Fe
   coordination in the heterojunctions are 1.93 and 2.92 angstrom,
   respectively, which are shorter than those in bulk Fe2O3. At a Fe2O3
   loading amount that is higher than the optimum value, trace amounts of
   isolated Fe2O3 and bulk Fe2O3 are likely formed at the heterojunction.
   This is unfavorable for electron-hole separation, and hence, detrimental
   to the photocatalytic activity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a numerical study of a metamaterial absorber
   that provides polarization-insensitive absorption over a broad bandwidth
   of operation over the mid-infrared region. The absorber consists of a
   periodically patterned metal-dielectric-metal structure integrated with
   an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) nanolayer into the insulating dielectric gap
   region. Such an anomalous broadband absorber is achieved thanks to a
   couple of resonant modes including plasmon and ENZ modes that are
   excited under mid-IR light illumination. By adding a 0.06-mu m-thick ENZ
   layer between the patterned gold rectangular grating and the SiO2
   dielectric layer, the absorber captures >95\% light over a 1.5 mu m
   bandwidth centered at a near-8-mu m wavelength over a wide range of
   oblique incidence under transverse-magnetic and -electric polarizations.
   The designed ENZ-based wideband absorber has potential for many
   practical applications, including sensing, imaging and solar energy
   harvesting over a wide frequency regime.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this experimental assessment is to examine the influence of
   an oscillating magnetic field on the thermal-conductivity of a
   water-Fe3O4 and water-Fe3O4/CNT ferro-fluids. Magnetic field is created
   by an electromagnet composed of a core made of ferrite and two copper
   windings. The impacts of magnetic field strength and frequency are also
   examined and the findings are compared with those of the constant
   magnetic field. The outcomes revealed that the pattern of
   thermal-conductivity in the attendance of a constant magnetic field is
   initially ascending and then descending. In addition, it was found that
   the descending trend of the thermal-conductivity can be prevented by
   using an oscillating magnetic field. Moreover, the results depicted that
   the most effective oscillating magnetic field has a frequency equal to
   the inverse of one minute less than time to reach the highest
   thermal-conductivity in the attendance of constant magnetic field.
   According to the results, the highest increase in the average
   thermal-conductivity of the water-Fe3O4 and water-Fe3O4/CNT ferro-fluids
   in the attendance of an oscillating magnetic field of 700 Gauss in
   comparison to the case of a constant magnetic field of 700 Gauss, is
   respectively 22.62 and 24.25\%.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of different parameters including nanoparticles mass
   fraction and temperature were investigated on rheological behavior and
   surface tension of iron(II) oxide/light crude oil nanofluid. Iron(II)
   oxide was dispersed in light crude oil by using ultrasonic processor.
   TEM images was provided in order to assess the size and morphology of
   iron(II) oxide nanoparticles. In addition, DLS analysis and Zeta
   potential test were performed on nanofluid for estimation of
   nanoparticles size distribution within the basefluid and stability of
   nanoparticles, respectively. The results of this study showed that for
   iron(II) oxide/light crude oil nanofluid the value of surface tension
   reach to its minimum value at the condition where nanoparticles mass
   fraction was chosen to be 2.0 wt\% and temperature was set on 70 degrees
   C. These results showed that for iron(ll) oxide/light crude oil
   nanofluid the rheological behavior of nanofluid is non-Newtonian at
   temperature of 40 degrees C and the suspension behave as a rheoplexy
   fluid in which by increasing the shear rate higher dynamic viscosity of
   nanofluid observed. Furthermore, nanofluid behaves as a Newtonian fluid
   for the temperature of higher than 55 degrees C. Finally, a
   comprehensive correlation was obtained for estimation of relative
   dynamic viscosity of nanofluid by hybrid group method of data handling
   (GMDH)-type neural network method. The correlation presented in this
   study shows that for the relative dynamic viscosity of iron(II)
   oxide/light crude oil as a function of nanoparticles mass fraction and
   temperature, the amount of the total deviation of calculated data from
   experimental values is less than 10\%. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A new optimization/statistical approach of ``Robust Weighted Least
   Squares Support Vector Regression{''} algorithm (RWLS-SVR) is provided
   for the first time. The experimental achieved amounts of the thermal
   conductivity for a new hybrid nanofluid of water/Graphene Oxide-Silicon
   Carbide, are examined at different values of temperature and
   nanoparticles volume fraction. A Support Vector Regression is a
   supervised learning regression algorithm based on the Support Vector
   Machine methodology. However in the Least Squares Support Vector Machine
   method, the inequality constraints are converted to equality constraints
   and the sum squared error function is employed. Moreover a LS-SVR is
   applied to the problem in order to calculate the error variables.
   Afterwards, the weights computed based on the error variables are
   applied to the optimization problem in order to reduce the effects of
   outliers on the final results. As a result, the WLS-SVR method does not
   significantly increase the computational burden, but it provides
   sparseness and robustness. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to investigate the hydrothermal and entropy generation
   characteristics of a non-Newtonian nanofluid containing CuO
   nanoparticles in an offset strip-fin microchannel heat sink (MCHS). The
   base fluid is solution of 0.5 wt\% Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) in
   water. This study investigates the effects of nanoparticles
   concentration, Reynolds number and geometric size of strip-fin on the
   performance of MCHS from the viewpoint of both the first and the second
   thermodynamic law. The results reveal that enhancing the Reynolds number
   improves the performance of MCHS by boosting the convective heat
   transfer coefficient of the working fluid which favourably reduces the
   CPU surface temperature and thermal entropy generation rate and
   importantly leads to the temperature uniformity of the CPU surface.
   However, increase in Reynolds number adversely affects both the pumping
   power and the frictional entropy generation in the system. Therefore,
   the optimal strip-fm size is investigated to find the optimum
   performance of the offset strip-fins MCHS from the viewpoint of both the
   first and the second thermodynamic law. The optimal results show that
   the highest ratio of heat transfer enhancement to pressure drop
   increment, using the nanofluid instead of base fluid, is 2.29. In
   addition in the optimal case, the minimum total entropy generation rate
   of the nanofluid is 2.7\% less than the base fluid.}},

Abstract = {{Heat transfer intensification is significant for enhancement of the
   performance of various industrial uses such as condensers. In addition,
   the presence of nanofluid considerably increases the thermal features of
   carrier fluid. In current paper, CuO nanoparticles involving different
   shapes have been employed for heat transfer augmentation in wavy channel
   with obstacles. This work tries to focus on the main flow pattern and
   indicate the highest operative terms on the heat rate. In order to do
   this, computational simulation was applied to simulate hydrothermal
   behavior. Significant parameter studies were performed to investigate
   the influences of wavelength and height ratios and velocity inlet.
   According to obtained results, suitable formula for Nusselt number is
   offered. Outputs show that Nu goes up with augment of height of obstacle
   due to increasing in strength of intensity. Also, thinner temperature
   boundary layer thickness can be seen for greater wavelength ratio. Our
   finding reveals that heat transfer rate increases more than 55\% as the
   spherical nanoparticles is replace by platelet ones. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{This paper presents a wideband, broad beamwidth, dual-polarized antenna
   for the indoor access points. Its primary radiating elements are two
   quasi-Yagi antennas, which are arranged orthogonally. The antenna
   element employs two balanced directors to broaden bandwidth and avoid
   the structural conflict of the orthogonal installation. A
   microstrip-slotline transformer is used in the feeding structure for
   allowing the wideband operation and high port-to-port isolation. The
   dual polarized quasi-Yagi antenna is incorporated with a metallic cavity
   in order to improve the unidirectional radiation in terms of gain,
   front-to-back ratio, and beamwidth. The final prototype has been
   fabricated and tested. The antenna yielded a wide impedance bandwidth
   covering a frequency range from 1.64 to 3.0 GHz (60\%) for both ports
   with port-to-port isolation of a higher than 25 dB. In addition, at both
   ports, the antenna achieves stable unidirectional radiation with broad
   beamwidth, high front-to-back ratio, and high radiation efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the current paper is modeling the thermal performance factor
   of water under influence of functionalized multi-walled carbon
   nanotubes. For this purpose, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been
   employed. The thermal performance factor of the nanofluid is related to
   the drop in pressure and heat transfer. Therefore, usually the data
   associated with it does not follow a specific trend. In such cases, the
   neural network can be used well. Here, an optimal neural network was
   designed with 65 neurons, the inputs of which were Reynolds number and
   volume fractions. Moreover, 78 data were used for modeling, which
   included 62 data for training and 16 data for testing the model. With
   the aim of evaluation of the precision of the modeling by ANN, the
   experimental results were compared with neural network outputs in all
   cases. The results revealed that optimal ANN model has adequate
   accurateness to predict the complex trend of thermal performance factor.

Abstract = {{In the present study, the thermal performance of an air-cooled,
   flat-plate heat sink in forced convection was performed using a
   three-dimensional analytical model. To validate the present model, this
   solution is compared with numerical and experimental results that agree.
   This research studies the influence of heat sink thermal performance and
   of environmental parameters on the heat sink's stability against thermal
   stress, which is essential for manufacturers' goals. The effective
   parameters on heat transfer rate from the surface of heat sink were
   investigated. Reynolds and Nusselt numbers, heat transfer coefficient,
   fins height, and fins number were studied under various air flow
   velocities. In addition, the thermal stress (structural stability
   method) was investigated. Enhancement of the airflow velocity caused the
   Nusselt number value to incline, which increases the heat transfer
   coefficient. Increasing the Reynolds number from 3.80{*}10(3) to
   2.28{*}10(4) leads to less thermal stress by 47.36\%, less deformation
   by 50\%, less surface temperature by 28.57\%, and, consequently, less
   geometry failure. Results depicted that pure convection has less heat
   transfer by 1.66\% compared with convection-radiation heat transfer, and
   enhancing the fins number and fins height reduces the surface
   temperature by 25\% and 20\%, respectively. As a result, the chosen
   range of the Reynolds number is totally suitable for this
   high-temperature device that does not allow thermal stress to deform the
   fins of the heat sink. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Strain effects on the electronic and optical properties of monolayer
   SnSe is studied by APW + lo method in DFT framework. The applied strains
   cause direct-indirect transition of SnSe band gap which is mainly
   constructed by s/p hybridization. The armchair epsilon(ac) and zigzag
   epsilon(zz) reduce the unstrained band gap of 1.05 eV down to 0 eV at
   12\% compression, but at 12\% tension, the band gap decreases to
   0.726-0.804 eV. The band gap always increases under biaxial strain
   epsilon(b) at 12\% compression to 12\% tension. We observe an
   enhancement of real epsilon(1) (omega) and imaginary epsilon(2) (omega)
   parts of dielectric function by 14\%-30\% of magnitude, wider peak
   distribution to infrared and ultra-violet regions, and appearance of new
   peaks in the epsilon(1) (omega) and epsilon(2) (omega) spectrums. As a
   consequence, the light absorption alpha(omega) is significantly enhanced
   in the ultra-violet region and the absorption even starts at lower
   energy at infrared region.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of an
   optimized artificial neural network and particle swarm optimization for
   estimating the energetic performance of a building integrated
   photovoltaic/thermal system. A performance evaluation criterion is
   defined in this study to assess the overall performance of the
   considered system. Then, the mentioned methods are used to identify a
   relationship between the input and output parameters of the system. The
   performance evaluation criterion was taken as the essential output of
   the system, while the input parameters were the channel length, channel
   depth, channel width, and the air mass flow rate. The results revealed
   that the coefficient of determination for the training phase of the
   artificial neural network and particle swarm optimization-artificial
   neural network methods is respectively 0.9982 and 0.9997, while it is
   0.9980 and 0.9997 for the testing phase. Moreover, the root mean square
   error for the training phase of the artificial neural network and
   particle swarm optimization-artificial neural network techniques was
   respectively 0.0462 and 0.0175, while it was 0.0493 and 0.0178 for the
   testing phase. Therefore, it was concluded that the particle swarm
   optimization-artificial neural network model could slightly perform a
   better performance compared to the conventional artificial neural
   network.}},

Abstract = {{Nano-fluidic flow and heat transfer around a horizontal cylinder at
   Reynolds numbers up to 250 are investigated by using weakly compressible
   smoothed particle hydrodynamics (WCSPH). To be able to simulate enhanced
   nanoparticle heat transfer, this manuscript describes for the first time
   a development that allows conductive and convective heat transfer to be
   modelled accurately for the Eckert problem using WCSPH. The simulations
   have been conducted for Pr=0.01-40 with nanoparticle volumetric
   concentrations ranging from 0 to 4\%. The velocity fields and the
   Nusselt profiles from the present simulations are in a good agreement
   with the experimental measurements. The results show that WCSPH is
   appropriate method for such numerical modelling. Additionally, the
   results of heat transfer characteristics of nano-fluid flow over a
   cylinder marked improvements comparing with the base fluids. This
   improvement is more evident in flows with higher Reynolds numbers and
   higher particle volume concentration.}},

Abstract = {{A low-profile, high gain Fabry-Perot Resonator antenna with a wide
   operation bandwidth (BW) is presented in this paper. The proposed design
   consists of an ellipse-shaped dipole as a wideband radiating source,
   which is reflected by an artificial magnetic conductor ground plane to
   achieve low-profile structure. The antenna gain can be significantly
   enhanced by the use of a half-wavelength-thick dielectric slab as a
   partial reflecting surface. Additionally, this dielectric slab also
   contributes to improving the radiation pattern characteristics of the
   proposed design, especially in the high frequency region. A final
   prototype with an overall size of 1.2 lambda(L) x 1.2 lambda(L) x 0.4
   lambda(L) (lambda(L) is free-space wavelength at the lowest frequency of
   3-dB gain BW) has been fabricated to validate the concept. The measured
   results show that the proposed antenna yielded a wide 3-dB gain BW of
   approximately 50.3\% with a peak gain of 14 dBi and impedance matching
   BW of 48.9\%.}},

Abstract = {{A simple design of circularly polarized slot-patch antenna array with
   broadband operation and compact size is presented in this article. The
   antenna element consists of a circular slot and a semicircular patch,
   which are etched on both sides of a substrate. For the gain and axial
   ratio (AR) bandwidth enhancement, its array antennas are implemented in
   a 2 x 2 arrangement and fed by a sequential-phase feeding network. The
   final 2 x 2 antenna array prototype with compact lateral dimension of
   0.8(L) x 0.8(L) ((L) is the lowest frequency within AR bandwidth)
   yielded a measured impedance bandwidth of 103.83\% (2.76-8.72 GHz) and a
   measured AR bandwidth of 94.62\% (2.45-6.85 GHz). The peak gain values
   within the AR bandwidth are from 2.85 to 8.71 dBi. A good agreement
   between the simulated and measured results is achieved. This antenna
   array is suitable for multiservice wireless systems covering WiMAX, WLAN
   and C-band applications such as satellite communications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a dual-band dual-sense circularly polarized (CP)
   antenna for S- and C-band applications. A semicircular patch and a
   circular slot are first designed to achieve wide operation bandwidth in
   the C-band with right-hand CP (RHCP), and then, a curved slot is
   properly inserted around the circular slot for S-band realization with
   left-hand CP (LHCP). Final antenna prototype has an overall size of 0.32
   lambda(L) x 0.32 lambda(L) x 0.01 lambda(L), where lambda(L) is
   free-space wavelength at the lowest CP frequency. Experimental results
   show that good CP characteristics for both RHCP and LHCP can be
   achieved. The measured -10 dB impedance bandwidth is from 2.2 to 6.5
   GHz, equivalent to about 98.8\%. Additionally, the measured 3 dB
   axial-ratio bandwidths for lower and upper bands are, respectively,
   4.9\% (2.4-2.52 GHz) and 40.8\% (4.0-6.05 GHz).}},

Abstract = {{Parametric studies on the optimization of baffles on vibration
   suppression of partially filled tanks coupled by structure have been
   widely conducted in literature. However, few studies focus on the effect
   of the position of the baffles on fluid flow stratification and

   determine the effect of external flow on circular obstacle baffles
   performance on suppressing the vibrations of coupled structure in a
   closed basin. The single degree of freedom model (mass-spring-damper) is
   used to model the structure that holds the tank. The coupled system is
   released from an initial displacement without a velocity. The governing
   mass, turbulent Navier-Stokes momentum, volume of fluid, and one degree
   of freedom structure equations are solved by the Pressure-Implicit with
   Splitting of Operators algorithm in fluids and Newmark method in
   structure. Based on a detailed study of transient structure motion
   coupled with sloshing dynamics, the optimal baffle location was
   achieved. Optimal position of the baffle and its width are
   systematically obtained with reference to the quiescent free surface.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to simulate the interaction between thermal surface
   radiation and nanofluid free convection in a two dimensional shallow
   cavity by lattice Boltzmann method. The supposed nanofluid is generated
   by a homogeneous mixture of water and nanoparticles of Al2O3. The upper
   and lower walls of cavity are maintained at cold and hot temperature,
   respectively; while the side walls are kept thermally insulated. The
   cavity aspect ratio is chosen as 5 which indicates a shallow one. The
   cavity all inner surfaces are considered as the gray diffuse emitters
   and reflectors of radiation. The computations are performed for the wide
   range of parameters as Ra = 10(4) and Ra = 10(5); epsilon = 0.5 and
   epsilon = 0.9 while nanoparticles volume fraction changes between
   0.0<phi<0.04 at each case. As a result, the effects of emissivity and
   Rayleigh number are studied on the total heat transfer of radiation and
   free convection of nanofluid. The suitable validations are examined
   beside the useful grid study procedure. The results are presented as the
   profiles of velocity and temperature and also the streamlines and
   isotherms. Moreover the local and averaged Nusselt numbers are provided
   for the coupled and uncoupled states of radiation and free convection
   heat transfer mechanisms. It is seen that Nu(m) of total free convection
   and radiation would be more at higher Ra and epsilon; which indicates
   that radiation heat transfer coupled with free convection might affect
   the flow field and improve the Nusselt number. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A dual linearly polarized antenna with a low profile and significantly
   enhanced operating bandwidth is proposed. The primary radiating elements
   are two conventional loop dipoles fed orthogonally by two printed baluns

   bandwidth is further improved by utilizing a metasurface inserted
   between the radiators and a shallow cavity reflector. This does not only
   lower the structure profile but also considerably improves the antenna
   gain. The final prototype with an overall size of 150mm x 150mm x 15mm
   (0.83 x 0.83 x 0.083 at the lowest operating frequency of 1.66GHz) has
   been realized and experimentally validated. The measurements resulted in
   a -10-dB impedance bandwidth covering a frequency range from 1.66GHz to
   2.80GHz (51.1\%) for both ports with an isolation of higher than 30dB

Abstract = {{This paper presents the effect of an air gap introduced between a planar
   feed and an extended hemispherical lens on the antenna's impedance,
   current distribution and radiation characteristics. Two selected planar
   feeds for study are slitline dipole and stripline dipole. The results
   showed that as a small gap is introduced, the input impedance of the
   slitline dipole was almost remained unchanged while that of the
   stripline dipole was changed remarkably. More importantly, the boresight
   gain and radiation efficiency of the slitline dipole was improved
   whereas those of the stripline dipole were degraded with the presence of
   this air gap. An overall performance comparison for these two designs
   will be detailed in the paper. This study provides useful guidelines of
   choosing the proper feed for THz integrated lens antenna applications,
   especially for indoor THz communication applications such as wireless
   local area networks and wireless personal area networks in the 300 GHz

Abstract = {{A circularly polarized (CP) crossed-dipole antenna with switchable
   rotating sense is presented. The proposed design has two main attractive
   features. First, a wide overlapped CP bandwidth (BW) is realized for
   both operating states. Second, unlike existing designs targeting a
   similar functionality, no biasing wire through ground plane is required,
   which significantly reduces the design complexity. The proposed design
   employs parasitic elements for two different roles. For RF signal, these
   parasitic elements open an additional CP resonance band to enhance the
   axial-ratio (AR) BW. Additionally, through RF chokes, they provide a de
   path to bias the p-i-n diodes. An antenna prototype was experimentally
   demonstrated with the capability of switching between two CP rotating
   senses in a frequency range from 1.1 to 2.02 GHz, equivalent to 58.9\%.
   The antenna also exhibits a wide -10 dB impedance BW of 53.3\% (1.1-1.9
   GHz) with a peak gain of around 9.1 dBi and front-to-back ratio of more
   than 15 dB.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated optical properties of Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) loaded
   into the crystal of a porous material ZIF-8, abbreviated as Au@ZIF-8, by
   a diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Au@ZIF-8 was synthesized by a
   reaction of ZIF-8 precursor with PVP-encapsulated-Au-NPs in methanol
   solution. The concentration of Au NPs in an aqueous solution of the
   ZIF-8 precursor was controlled from 0.05 mL to 1.0 mL. The crystal
   structure of ZIF-8 and detailed formation of Au@ZIF-8 are fully
   characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis, Raman
   spectroscopy, SEM, and TEM images. The upper limit of concentration for
   Au NPs positioned inside ZIF-8 crystal is approximately 0.05 mL. At
   higher concentrations, the crystal size of ZIF-8 becomes smaller; and
   some Au NPs are observed to be located outside the framework. The
   optical spectra of Au@ZIF-8 exhibit two main absorption bands at
   approximate to 520 nm and approximate to 820 nm. The former of which is
   attributed to the surface plasmon resonance of Au NPs, while the band at
   approximate to 820 nm can be assigned to the longitudinal mode and/or
   collective plasmonic modes, as long as the particles are closely
   aggregated. Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) calculation for
   extinction cross-section spectrum for a BCC arrangement of Au NPs with
   the radius of 5 nm and the center-to-center distance of 13 nm was
   utilized to confirm the observation of new optical response of Au@ZIF-8.
   The calculation is in rather good agreement with the experimental data
   showing two main bands at approximate to 500 nm and approximate to 800
   nm. This work suggests a way to create a magnetic material in optical
   frequency in case of locating Au NPs periodically in the pores of ZIF-8
   or more generally in the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). (C) 2018

Abstract = {{In the present study, the effect of attack angle of triangular ribs, by
   using finite volume method, has been numerically studied in a
   two-dimensional microchannel. The cooling fluid is water/Ag nanofluid
   with volume fractions of 0-4\% of nanoparticles, and nanoparticle
   diameters are 25, 50 and 75 nm. The nanofluid flow has been considered
   as laminar with Reynolds numbers of 5, 100 and 500. Also, the attack
   angles have been studied at the range of 30A degrees-60A degrees. In
   this study, the effects of variations in attack angles on triangular
   ribs, volume fraction of nanoparticles, nanoparticles diameter and
   Reynolds number have been investigated. The results indicate that using
   nanoparticles with smaller diameter improves heat transfer rate.
   Moreover, it is shown that the friction coefficient and pumping power
   are almost independent of nanoparticle diameter. However, increasing
   Reynolds number, pumping power enhancement becomes more important by
   increasing the volume fraction of nanoparticles. In low Reynolds
   numbers, the influence of ribs is approximately insignificant on the
   streamlines; it is very effective in high Reynolds numbers. The
   existence of rib on the direction of fluid motion causes asymmetrical
   velocity profile in the top section of the rib. Using triangular rib
   with higher attack angle can improve heat transfer significantly due to
   the high-velocity gradients and better mixing of fluid flow.}},

Abstract = {{We present a numerical investigation of tapered arteries that addresses
   the transient simulation of non-Newtonian bio-magnetic fluid dynamics
   (BFD) of blood through a stenosis artery in the presence of a transverse
   magnetic field. The current model is consistent with ferro-hydrodynamic
   (FHD) and magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) principles. In the present work,
   blood in small arteries is analyzed using the Carreau-Yasuda model. The
   arterial wall is assumed to be fixed with cosine geometry for the
   stenosis. A parametric study was conducted to reveal the effects of the
   stenosis intensity and the Hartman number on a wide range of flow
   parameters, such as the flow velocity, temperature, and wall shear
   stress. Current findings are in a good agreement with recent findings in
   previous research studies. The results show that wall temperature
   control can keep the blood in its ideal blood temperature range (below
   40 degrees C) and that a severe pressure drop occurs for blockages of
   more than 60 percent. Additionally, with an increase in the Ha number, a
   velocity drop in the blood vessel is experienced.}},

   prototype with overall size of 1.2 lambda(fmin) X 1.2 lambda(fmin) X 0.6
   lambda(fmin) has been fabricated and experimentally validated
   (lambda(fmin) being the free-space wavelength at the minimum operating
   frequency). The measured impedance matching and axial ratio bandwidths
   are approximately 55.7\% and 47.7\%, respectively. Additionally, the
   antenna achieved 3-dB gain bandwidth of 50.9\% with a peak gain of 15

Abstract = {{Shrinking the linewidth of resonances induced by multiple coupled
   resonators is comprehensively analyzed using the coupled-mode theory
   (CMT) in time. Two types of coupled resonators under investigation are
   coupled resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) and side-coupled resonators
   with waveguide (SCREW). We examine the main parameters influencing on
   the spectral response such as the number of resonators (n) and the phase
   shift (phi) between two adjacent resonators. For the CROWs geometry
   consisting of n coupled resonators, we observe the quality (Q) factor of
   the right-and left-most resonant lineshapes increases n times larger
   than that of a single resonator. For the SCREW geometry, relying on the
   phase shift, sharp, and asymmetric resonant lineshape of the high Q
   factor a narrow linewidth of the spectral response could be achieved. We
   employ the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to design and
   simulate two proposed resonators for practical applications. The
   proposed coupled resonators in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) slotted
   two-dimensional (2-D) photonic crystals (PhCs) filled and covered with a
   low refractive index organic material. Slotted PhC waveguides and
   cavities are designed to enhance the electromagnetic intensity and to
   confine the light into small cross-sectional area with low refractive
   index so that efficient optical devices could be achieved. A good
   agreement between the theoretical CMT analysis and the FDTD simulation
   is shown as an evidence for our accurate investigation. All-optical
   switches based on the CROWs in the SOI slotted 2-D PhC waveguide that
   are filled and covered by a nonlinear organic cladding to overcome the
   limitations of its well-known intrinsic properties are also presented.
   From the calculations, we introduce a dependency of the normalized
   linewidth of the right-most resonance and its switching power of the
   all-optical switches on number of resonator, n. This result might
   provide a guideline for all-optical signal processing on a silicon PhC
   chip design. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Abstract = {{Thermal loading by radiant heaters is used in building heating and hot
   structure design applications. In this research, characteristics of the
   thermal radiative heating of an enclosure by a distinct heater are
   investigated from the second law of thermodynamics point of view. The
   governing equations of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy (fluid
   and solid) are solved by the finite volume method and the semi-implicit
   method for pressure linked equations (SIMPLE) algorithm. Radiant heaters
   are modeled by constant heat flux elements, and the lower wall is held
   at a constant temperature while the other boundaries are adiabatic. The
   thermal conductivity and viscosity of the fluid are
   temperature-dependent, which leads to complex partial differential
   equations with nonlinear coefficients. The parameter study is done based
   on the amount of thermal load (presented by heating number) as well as
   geometrical configuration parameters, such as the aspect ratio of the
   enclosure and the radiant heater number. The results present the effect
   of thermal and geometrical parameters on entropy generation and the
   distribution field. Furthermore, the effect of thermal radiative heating
   on both of the components of entropy generation (viscous dissipation and
   heat dissipation) is investigated.}},

   and 2000. The effect of volume fraction of nanoparticles in the
   Newtonian suspension of water based nanofluid was studied for values of
   0, 0.04 and 0.08. The results showed that the thermal resistance and
   ratio of maximum and minimum temperature difference for bottom wall of
   microchannel as well as the ratio of thermal resistance decrease by
   increasing the nanoparticles volume fraction and decrement of lambda.
   The Performance evaluation criteria (PEC) factor on the bottom of

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the near-field enhanced optical absorption
   and far-field radiation characteristics of plasmonic dipole nano-antenna
   with different geometries which are rectangular, square, circular, and

   reflection profile in an infinite 2D array of each nano-antenna are
   characterized and optimized at the resonant frequency of 375 THz, which
   corresponds to the incident wavelength of 800 nm. Numerical results show
   that the ellipse nano-antenna produces the most enhanced electric field
   at the excitation gap whereas the circular nano-antenna yields the best
   reflection and far-field radiation characteristics. This research is
   useful for the researchers and designers in choosing appropriate
   plasmonic dipole nano-antennas when incorporating with a photoconductive

Abstract = {{In this paper, a design of a planar, low-profile, and high gain
   Fabry-Perot cavity antenna for K-band applications is presented. The
   antenna is consisted of a frequency selective surface (FSS) made of a
   circular hole array and a feeding structure made of a coupled
   strip-slitline. The FSS and the slitline both are lithographically
   patterned on a high permittivity substrate while the stripline is
   printed on top of a thin and low permittivity substrate. These two
   substrates are then closely appressed each other to form a planar
   structure. The measured results show that the proposed antenna has an
   impedance bandwidth of about 4\% (vertical bar S11 vertical bar <=-10
   dB), a maximum gain of about 10.4 dBi, and a 3-dB gain bandwidth of
   approximately 2.9\% at the resonance frequency of around 20.8 GHz. The
   antenna's compact, planar, and lightweight profile, i.e., approximately
   4 lambda(o) x 4 lambda(o) x 0.24 lambda(o) of a free-space wavelength at
   21.0 GHz makes it promising for a small and efficient source in K-band
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the ternary interaction of N, H, and vacancy point
   defects and the nitrogen trapping ability of aluminum vacancies induced

   energy of 0.65 eV is close to experimental values. Although the
   N-vacancy complex is unstable with the negative binding energy of -0.51
   eV, the stability of H-vacancy-N is proved by the positive binding
   energy of 0.59 eV and the appearance of the orbital hybridization in the
   density of state (DOS) of atoms connecting to this complex. Moreover, Al
   vacancies can trap more than 4 N atoms, which prevents the formation of
   aluminum nitride and subsequently affects not only the hardness of the
   Al surface but also many practical applications of AIN coating.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we numerically introduce a planar metamolecule that
   generates plasmonic Fano resonance. The engineered molecule consists of
   closely packed asymmetric gold nanodisks deposited on a glass substrate
   operating at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. The asymmetric
   arrangement of nanodisks plays a key role in Fano resonance generation.
   The induced extinction cross-section spectroscopy has a Fano-like shape
   owing to interference between bright and dark plasmonic modes sustained
   by the asymmetric nanodisk clusters. The Fano dips are shown to be
   highly sensitive to the interdisk gaps as well as to the surrounding
   environment. As a result, we introduce a potential refractive index
   nanosensor having a sensitivity of 660 nm/RIU and a figure of merit of
   4.75. The proposed metamolecule holds potential for various
   applications, such as Fano-induced enhancement of solar energy
   harvesting, molecular fluorescence, and photo upconversion. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{We designed various photoconductive antennas applicable to efficient
   terahertz (THz) receivers and experimentally investigated their
   detection characteristics. Three different antennas based on
   Grischkowsky (H-), I-, and bowtie shapes were fabricated on a 1.2- mu
   m-thick low-temperature GaAs layer that was grown on a semi-insulating
   GaAs substrate and subsequently attached to extended hemispherical
   silicon lenses. The experimental results showed different
   characteristics for detection responsivity and agreed well with the
   theoretical prediction. Measurements of the peak-to-peak amplitudes of
   the detected THz photocurrent were approximately 67, 42, and 59 nA for
   the H-shaped, I-shaped, and bowtie-shaped antennas, respectively. The I-
   and bowtie-shaped antennas provided higher THz detection sensitivities
   than the H-shaped antenna in the low-frequency region, i.e., below 0.6
   THz. At a frequency of 0.2 THz, the I- and bowtie-shaped antennas
   offered an approximately 3.6-fold and 6-fold enhancement, respectively,
   in THz detection sensitivity compared to the H-shaped antenna. The
   bowtie-shaped antenna produced better peak amplitude and a wider
   spectral bandwidth than the I-shaped antenna. The observed detection
   peak frequencies of the I-shaped and bowtie-shaped antennas possessing
   very long dipole arms indicate that the lowest limit of the frequency
   detected in a typical THz-TDS using a GaAs photoconductive antenna as
   emitter/detector is around 0.2 THz. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V All rights

Abstract = {{We revisit previous studies of metallic gratings for optical absorption
   enhancement in an organic solar cell with a thin active layer. Our
   device geometry is designed for a real solar cell with full of
   functional layers. Various metallic gratings calibrated to generate
   periodic scatterers and low reflectors for broad-band light account for
   increases in short circuit current density of up to 47\% when compared
   to its flat counterpart. We found that the tapered grating has greater
   performance than the regular rectangular grating for transverse magnetic
   (TM) polarization while the latter shows better performance for
   transverse electric (TE) polarization. The overall metallic grating
   induced absorption enhancement was found at all angles of incidence. The
   best configuration was realized for the tapered grating-based solar cell
   at 25 of inclination. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Perovskite has recently drawn substantial interest in photovoltaic
   research owing to its unique potentials of low cost fabrication and high
   power conversion efficiency. In this paper, a thin solar cells made of
   perovskite photoactive layer is introduced. The proposed

   (p-ARFE) made of fiber arrays is calibrated to generate
   lensing/anti-reflecting effects and thus resulting in improved
   absorption efficiency. Theoretical and numerical results have
   demonstrated that the overall integrated AM1.5 G absorption in an
   optimal configuration yields a maximum short circuit current density of
   20.2 mA cm(-2) and an enhancement up to 6.3\% compared to its flat solar
   cell counterpart with a same perovskite thickness of 200 nm. The
   proposed p-ARFE solar cell also presents a relative broadband absorption
   characteristic with zero reflection at multiple visible frequencies,
   i.e., 360-750 nm, thus more benefiting associated with next-generation

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate optical properties of metal nanoparticle
   crystals fabricated by implanting copper (Cu) ions into single silica
   (SiO2) crystals with 400 key at various ion doses. The Cu implanted SiO2
   (SiO2:Cu) crystal produces a broadband luminescence emission, ranging
   from blue to yellow, and having a blue luminescence peak at 546 nm. Such
   anomalous luminescence emission bands suggest that the ion implantation
   may give rise to aggregation of Cu nanoparticles in the host matrix. The
   boundary element method-based modelling of a given Cu nanoparticle
   aggregation was employed to justify the broadband luminescence emission.
   Formation of Cu nanoparticles in SiO2 is predicted through their optical
   absorption data. The experimental results are compared with results of
   Mie calculations and we observe that the higher ion dose produces the
   larger particle size. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   the tapered slit is optimized to enable the impedance matching and thus
   broaden the transmission at a specific incidence angle, the Brewster

Abstract = {{We designed a slit dipole antenna backed by an extended hemispherical
   silicon lens and investigated the minimum lens size in which the slit
   dipole antenna works as a leaky-wave antenna. The slit dipole antenna
   consists of a planar feeding structure, which is a center-fed and

   hemispherical silicon lens is investigated over a frequency range from
   0.2 to 0.4 THz with the center frequency at 0.3 THz. The numerical
   results show that the antenna gain responses exhibited an increased
   level of sensitivity to the lens size and increased linearly with
   increasing lens radius. The lens with the radius of 1.2 lambda(o) is
   found to be the best possible minimum lens size for a slit dipole

Abstract = {{This paper presents an optimum design of a substrate-integrated
   cavity-type antenna for use in the terahertz frequency range. The
   antenna was designed with a frequency-selective surface (FSS) and a
   planar feeding structure that are both patterned on a high-permittivity
   gallium-arsenide substrate. The FSS, printed on the bottom side of the
   substrate, is made of a circular hole array that acts as a partially
   reflecting mirror. Meanwhile, the planar feeding structure, printed on
   the top side of the substrate, is a center-fed, open-ended slotline
   whose ground plane acts as a perfect reflective mirror; thus, it forms a
   Fabry-Perot resonator. The optimized antenna produced a maximum
   boresight gain of 14.3 dBi, a radiation efficiency of 62\%, and
   side-lobe levels of -15.1 dB and -15.0 dB for the E- and H-planes,
   respectively, at a resonance frequency of 320 GHz. The proposed design
   exhibits compactness, planarity, and light weight compared with the
   substrate lens-coupled antenna design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, a study of a stripline dipole antenna on a substrate lens
   used as a photoconductive detector in a terahertz system is presented.
   The traveling-wave behavior of the stripline dipole and the influence of
   the substrate lens are investigated over a broad frequency range up to
   5.0 THz. The numerical results show that the lens shape represented by
   the ratio of the extension length to the lens radius plays an important
   role in maximizing the antenna gain and radiation spectral bandwidth.
   The gain response exhibited an increased level of sensitivity to the
   lens shape as the lens size increased, and this is particularly
   important in optimizing large substrate lenses. Improvements in the gain
   level over the entire frequency range of interest were observed as the
   lens diameter increased. This study provides helpful guidelines in
   choosing and optimizing a substrate lens designed for a terahertz
   photoconductive antenna, which is particularly useful for specific
   applications requiring a miniaturized photoconductive antenna design.

Abstract = {{The input impedance and radiation characteristics of a stripline dipole
   antenna on different substrate schemes are presented. Two radiation
   environments, a semi-infinite gallium-arsenide substrate (hereafter
   called a ``semi-infinite substrate{''}) and a thin gallium-arsenide
   substrate backed by a silicon lens (hereafter a ``lens substrate{''}),
   were examined, and the antenna performances were analyzed in a broad
   frequency range up to 5.0 THz. The semi-infinite substrate approach is
   useful in the initial investigation of the antenna characteristic itself
   while saving a significant amount of computational time. The study
   provides good guidelines for the design of a terahertz photoconductive
   antenna in that the antenna effect and the lens substrate effect can be
   individually characterized and optimized for the best possible

Abstract = {{We investigated the dependence of the input impedance and radiation
   characteristics on the connection angle between the DC bias stripline
   and the center dipole of a terahertz coplanar stripline dipole antenna
   in a semi-infinite substrate. Three connection angles, namely 0 degrees
   (typical horizontal connection), 45 degrees (diagonal connection), and
   90 degrees (vertical connection), were examined and an overall
   performance comparison was provided. The antenna with a sufficiently
   long bias stripline exhibited a traveling-wave behavior with stable
   impedance variation, regardless of the connection angle between the DC
   bias stripline and the center dipole. The antenna with diagonal and
   vertical bias connections performed much better than the typical
   H-shaped electrode with a horizontal bias connection in terms of
   radiation characteristics exhibiting flat gain and low frequency cut-off
   of the radiation efficiency. In addition, the antenna with a diagonal
   bias connection exhibited a better radiation pattern and more efficient
   use of a given substrate area than that with a vertical bias connection.
   The result indicates that in terms of the overall aspect of the
   terahertz stripline dipole antenna designs on a high-dielectric-constant
   substrate, the antenna with a diagonal bias connection is the best
   configuration.}},

Abstract = {{A full-wavelength dipole antenna on a GaAs membrane, covered with a
   silicon lens to improve the output power of a terahertz (THz)
   photomixer, is proposed. A full-wavelength dipole antenna supported by a
   GaAs membrane structure has been proven to achieve both high input
   resistance and high radiation efficiency for improved overall
   efficiency. However, the antenna has insufficient directivity. An
   extended hemispherical lens was introduced in front of the antenna in a
   non-contact configuration and coupled to the antenna radiation to
   achieve high directivity by beam collimation. This approach greatly
   enhances the antenna directivity while avoiding an inherent obstacle of
   the input resistance reduction caused by the high permittivity lens
   substrate. The resulting antenna after optimization had a 3818-Omega
   input resistance and a 71.2\% radiation efficiency, corresponding to
   approximately 57\% total efficiency at the 1.07-THz resonance frequency.
   The total efficiency of this structure is approximately 6.8 times that
   of a full-wavelength dipole antenna with the same hemisphere lens size
   while exhibiting slightly lower directivity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a full-wavelength dipole antenna, supported by a GaAs
   membrane structure, is examined. The antenna was designed with both high
   input resistance and high radiation efficiency to improve the overall
   efficiency of a terahertz photomixer design. The geometrical effects of
   the GaAs membrane structure on the overall antenna performance were
   investigated through an optimization process. To supply DC bias to the
   antenna, a bias line with a photonic bandgap (PBG) structure was
   designed and optimized. The resulting antenna had a 2742-Omega input
   resistance and a 65\% radiation efficiency, corresponding to an
   approximately 44\% total efficiency at the 1.05-THz resonance frequency.
   The proposed antenna is expected to efficiently generate THz waves and
   be applicable to many practical applications where large coverage
   (detection area), easy alignment, and high scanning speed, rather than
   high-resolution, are preferred.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the output power of a photomixer used as a THz source, we
   propose a four-leaf-clover-shaped antenna structure composed of a highly
   resonant radiation element and a stable DC feed element. The resonance
   characteristics of the proposed structure were first investigated on a
   half-infinite substrate as a simplified radiation environment to reduce
   the computation time. Based on the antenna characteristics on that
   half-infinite substrate, the antenna structure was designed to have a
   maximum total efficiency and a maximum directivity on an extended
   hemispherical lens. The input resistance of this structure was six times
   that of a full-wavelength dipole, significantly improving the mismatch
   efficiency between a photomixer and the antenna. The terahertz output
   power from this structure is expected to be 2.7 times that of a

Abstract = {{We propose a multiband antenna that exhibits a dual coupling
   characteristic and dual frequency operation using a dual spiral
   stripline-loaded monopole in conjunction with L-shaped slots in a ground

   an additional monopole that resonates in concordance with the existing
   resonances of the upper and lower spiral stripline monopoles. As a
   result, the impedance bandwidths are greatly enhanced while maintaining
   relatively good omnidirectional radiation characteristics. The proposed
   antenna occupies a volume of 36 7 102 mm including the ground plane, and
   the measured impedance bandwidths with VSWR simultaneously cover CDMA,
   GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, UMTS, IMT-2000, and WiMAX2350 bands. We
